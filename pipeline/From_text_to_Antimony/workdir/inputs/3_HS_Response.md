s70 and RNA polymerase (RNAP) bind together to form 
s70_RNAP, which then dissociates into s70 and RNAP. Pg and 
s70_RNAP bind to create Pg_s70_RNAP, which can dissociate 
back into its components. RNAP and s32 bind to create 
RNAP_s32, which can dissociate into RNAP and s32. Ph and 
RNAP_s32 bind to form Ph_RNAP_s32, which then 
dissociates back into Ph and RNAP_s32. Additionally, s32 and 
DnaK form s32_DnaK, which can dissociate into s32 and 
DnaK, while s32 and FtsH bind to create s32_FtsH, which can 
dissociate back into s32 and FtsH. Similarly, Punfold and DnaK 
bind to form Punfold_DnaK, which can dissociate into Punfold 
and DnaK.
mRNA_s32is upregurated by Pg_s70_RNAP. Similarly, mRNA_DnaK and mRNA_FtsH are positively regulated by Ph_RNAP_s32. mRNA_Protein is transcribed without regulation. s32, FtsH, DnaK, and Pfold are translated from mRNA_s32, mRNA_FtsH, mRNA_DnaK, andmRNA_Protein, respectively. All the mRNAs (mRNA_s32, mRNA_DnaK,mRNA_FtsH,andmRNA_Protein) decay. s32, s32_DnaK, s32_FtsH, s32_DnaK_FtsH, FtsH, DnaK, Punfold_DnaK, Pfold, and Punfold decay. RNAP_s32 is
degraded into RNAP. Similarly, Ph_RNAP_s32 is degraded into Ph and RNAP. D_RNAP_s32 is degraded into RNAP_D.
