None of these models adequately address
the fact that the bd1 SM has different fates in
the tassel and ear. It is unlikely that bd1b
partially compensates for the loss of BD1 in
the tassel, as proposed for the zag1/zmm2
duplication in maize (14), because we have
been unable to detect bd1b transcript in any
tissues (15). It is possible that a different
tassel-specific factor may function redun-
dantly with bd1. Given the intense selective
pressure on the maize ear, it is not surprising
that the ear and tassel are genetically distinct. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.116,r=0.348,b=0.275), with ID 0567a3a0-2a4f-4c3e-911a-a3e0a3ced00f -->

The expression pattern and mutant pheno-
type of bd1 show similarities to the FIM-
BRIATA/UFO genes of Antirrhinum and Ara-
bidopsis, respectively (16, 17). Both genes
are expressed in a ring at the base of the floral
meristem adjacent to the sepals, and the An-
tirrhinum mutant shows a partial loss of lat-
eral determinacy within the meristem. In the
case of UFO, the basal floral meristems may
be replaced with cofloroscence branches
(18). In Arabidopsis, the UFO and LEAFY
genes have been proposed to be coregulators
of floral meristem identity (19). Therefore,
BD1 may interact with other SM identity
factors to impose determinate meristem fates.
As in wild type, the maize LEAFY ortholog is
expressed in the SPMs and SMs of bd1 mu-
tants (5). However, the genetic interaction
between bd1 and leafy is unknown and awaits
identification of leafy mutants in maize. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.276,r=0.349,b=0.540), with ID 920727d0-997d-453c-bf51-9e15ddc2a569 -->

To date, bd1 is the only maize mutant that specifically displays altered SM identity. Several maize mutants that affect SM determinacy have been described, such as Tassel-seed6 (20) and indeterminate spikelet1 (21). Both these mutants display SMs that initiate more than two florets per spikelet, and interestingly, both show normal patterns of bd1 expression in the SM (fig. S1). The latter result indicates that SM identity is acquired before SM determinacy. Recently, it has been shown that SM identity and determinacy are interdependent, as two genes that control SM determinacy, indeterminate spikelet1 and indeterminate floral apex1, also show SM identity defects as a double mutant (22). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.540,r=0.349,b=0.752), with ID eac3a5fa-a794-4143-85c7-624ba27a5849 -->

The grass spikelet is conventionally interpreted as a strongly contracted branch system—literally, a little spike (23). If this interpretation is correct, then genes should exist that, when mutated, cause the spikelet to revert to a branchlike structure. We have identified a gene that regulates spikelet versus branch meristem fates within the inflorescence of maize, and whose sequence and expression are conserved in other grasses such as rice and sorghum. Our data suggest that the expression of bdl is fundamental to grass spikelet formation and may have played a role in the origin of this evolutionary novelty. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.075,t=0.752,r=0.349,b=0.951), with ID d2921fe1-1ee2-4a87-aea7-cb1ba788537f -->

Nuclear localization of the transcriptional activator NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) is controlled in mammalian cells by three isoforms of NF-κB inhibitor protein: IκBα, -β, and -ε. Based on simplifying reductions of the IκB–NF-κB signaling module in knockout cell lines, we present a computational model that describes the temporal control of NF-κB activation by the coordinated degradation and synthesis of IκB proteins. The model demonstrates that IκBα is responsible for strong negative feedback that allows for a fast turn-off of the NF-κB response, whereas IκBβ and -ε function to reduce the system’s oscillatory potential and stabilize NF-κB responses during longer stimulations. Bimodal signal-processing characteristics with respect to stimulus duration are revealed by the model and are shown to generate specificity in gene expression. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.404,t=0.486,r=0.894,b=0.673), with ID 9810c8b3-320a-4335-9075-9f1e5051a287 -->

The transcription factor NF-κB regulates numerous genes that play important roles in inter- and intracellular signaling, cellular stress responses, cell growth, survival, and apoptosis (1–3). As such, the specificity and temporal control of gene expression are of crucial physiological interest.

Five related mammalian gene products
participate in NF-κB functions (RelA/p65,
cRel, RelB, p50, p52), but the predominant
species in many cell types is a p65:p50 het-
erodimer. Its activity is largely controlled by
three IκB isoforms (IκBα, -β, and -ε) that
bind to NF-κB, preventing its association
with DNA and causing its localization to the
cytoplasm. Signals from various stimuli are
transduced to the IκB kinase (IKK) complex,
which phosphorylates each IκB isoform,
leading to its ubiquitination and proteolysis
(6). IκB degradation allows NF-κB to trans-
locate to the nucleus and bind DNA (Fig.
1A). The specific role of each IκB protein in
regulating NF-κB is not understood. Mice <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.656,t=0.739,r=0.931,b=0.952), with ID 2f5ce555-3a01-4a03-9fc1-3de9bcbc9b18 -->

with an engineered deletion of one IκB gene
show notable molecular compensation by the
remaining IκB family members (7, 3) and
mild phenotypes (8, 9). The IκBα–/– mouse,
however, is perinatal lethal with multi-organ
inflammation presumably caused by up-reg-
ulation of many NF-κB–responsive genes
(10, 11). This phenotype is largely rescued by
placing the IκBβ coding region under tran-
scriptional control of IκBα (12). IκBα syn-
thesis is controlled by a highly NF-κB–re-
sponsive promoter generating autoregulation
of NF-κB signaling (13). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.072,t=0.087,r=0.351,b=0.261), with ID d0680955-111f-4e05-8ab0-ca75a48e5567 -->

The interactions of IKK, IκB isoforms,
and NF-κB can be thought of as a negative
feedback-containing signal-transduction mod-
ule (Fig. 1A) that receives signals from path-
ways emanating from cell-surface receptors
(input) and transmits signals to nuclear pro-
moter-bound protein complexes regulating
gene expression (output). In a minimal sys-
tem with negative feedback (Fig. 1B), cross-
regulation between the two signaling compo-
nents determines the strength of the negative
feedback (constants β and γ) and thus the
propensity for oscillations, whereas self-reg-
ulation (constants α and δ) determines the
degree of damping. Depending on the values
of these constants, the response to persistent
stimulation may thus vary from continual
oscillations, to damped oscillations, to a vir-
tually monotonic rise to a plateau level (Fig.
1B). We examined the dynamics of IκB–NF-
κB signaling experimentally by measuring
nuclear NF-κB (NF-κBn) activity with the
electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)
(14). Two phases of NF-κB activation were
revealed in response to the stimulation of
tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α) in various
human and mouse cell lines (Fig. 1C). Al-
though the degree and precise timing of
postinduction attenuation are variable (15,
16), the output resembles strongly damped
oscillations but is distinct from that predicted
for a minimal two-component system (Fig.
1B). We conclude that the coordinated deg-
radation, synthesis, and localization of all
three IκB isoforms is required to generate the
characteristic NF-κB activation profile. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.261,r=0.351,b=0.738), with ID 2280d8a5-a233-4899-b6e4-2ead8d5d4213 -->

To address their differential functions, we
constructed a computational model based on
ordinary differential equations. The model
behavior depends on the specific values of
various control parameters, including those
describing (i) the synthesis of each IκB iso-
form (transcription, mRNA stability, and
translation), (ii) the stability of free and NF-
κB–bound IκB proteins, (iii) the formation
of binary and tertiary IKK–IκB–NF-κB com-
plexes, (iv) the enzymatic rate constants of
IKK-containing complexes, and (v) the trans-
port rates affecting localization of each of the
components (IκBα, -β, and -ε; NF-κB; and
derived complexes). Many of the 30 indepen-
dent model parameters have been previously <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.739,r=0.351,b=0.953), with ID 4d2bdc48-4b5b-4f2b-83e4-5ed7c0602b6a -->

others may be constrained by published data

IκB–NF-κB signaling modules of reduced
complexity and to provide further constraints
for effective model parameter fitting. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.365,t=0.066,r=0.641,b=0.168), with ID a42ae46d-1ba3-4142-b6ba-e2f575b24871 -->

We engineered mice deleted for *IκBβ* and
-ε with the use of standard homologous re-
combination technology of embryonic stem
cells (14). These mice, as well as existing
*IκBα* gene–deleted mice (10), were inter-
crossed appropriately to yield embryonic fi-
broblasts in which the nuclear localization of
NF-κB was controlled by a single IκB iso-
form (14). TNFα stimulation of fibroblasts
that contained only the IκBα isoform resulted
in a highly oscillatory NF-κB response, with
four equally spaced peaks over the course of
the 6-hour experiment (Fig. 2A, top). In con-
trast, in cells harboring only IκBβ (Fig. 2A,
center) or -ε (Fig. 2A, bottom), NF-κB in-
creased monotonically to a plateau at 1 hour
with no notable subsequent repression. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.366,t=0.168,r=0.641,b=0.393), with ID 93cad85f-2836-46e2-97ab-5f166d8a4939 -->

The simplified computational models of  
$\beta^{-/-}\epsilon^{-/-}$, $\alpha^{-/-}\beta^{-/-}$, and $\alpha^{-/-}\epsilon^{-/-}$ cells each contain 17 partially overlapping parameters that control the output, 9 of which have been biochemically determined previously. In addition, five transport parameters are constrained by ratios derived from steady state nuclear and cytoplasmic localization (_17, 18_). Their absolute values, as well as I$\kappa$B synthesis parameters, were determined by semiquantitative fitting of the model outputs to the experimental data. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.366,t=0.394,r=0.641,b=0.540), with ID dd33f3dd-55ce-41d3-b438-a01bcf35703c -->

Combining the three models of genetically
reduced signaling modules results in a
computational model of the IκB–NF-κB sig-
naling module in wild-type cells. Varying
their relative contributions revealed discrete
functional roles for the mammalian IκB pro-
teins in NF-κB regulation (Fig. 2D). IκBα
mediates rapid NF-κB activation and strong
negative feedback regulation, resulting in an
oscillatory NF-κB activation profile. IκBβ
and -ε respond more slowly to IKK activation
and act to dampen the long-term oscillations
of the NF-κB response. The interplay be-
tween these isoforms can result in remarkably
rapid responses to the onset or cessation of
stimulation and can allow a relatively stable
NF-κB response during long-term stimula-
tion (Fig. 2D, middle). In the absence of
strong damping mechanisms, high negative
feedback efficiency can lead to long-term
oscillations in the output (Fig. 2D, top), as
observed, for example, in p53-mdm2 cross-
regulation (19). In wild-type NF-κB signal-
ing, pronounced oscillations are absent and
may be detrimental, as IκBβ–/–IκBε–/– fe-
males have a dramatically shortened fertility
span (3). Our results also suggest that varying
relative synthesis levels of IκBα, -β, and -ε
may constitute a mechanism for altering the
responsiveness of the NF-κB signal transduc-
tion pathway, a mechanism that cells or cell
lineages may use in response to environmen-
tal or developmental cues. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.655,t=0.088,r=0.932,b=0.530), with ID ecd5ffaa-2327-436c-bb2d-1b4f0f9e40d3 -->

# C. Experimental Data: NF-κB Oscillations in Different Cell Types
Title & Axes :
  • No explicit title; three panels labeled by cell type.
  • Cell types: human Jurkat T cells, human U937 monocytes, mouse fibroblasts.
  • Time points (min): 0, 10, 30, 60, 90, 2, 3, 4, 6 hr.
Data Points :
  • Each panel shows a series of bands (EMSA for NF-κB) at each time point.
  • Band intensity varies over time, indicating nuclear NF-κB levels.
Design Encodings :
  • Black and white gel images; darker bands indicate higher NF-κB DNA binding.
  • Time course for each cell type.
Distribution & Trends :
  • Jurkat T cells: Bands appear, intensify, and then diminish, suggesting oscillatory nuclear NF-κB.
  • U937 monocytes: Similar pattern, with visible changes in band intensity over time.
  • Mouse fibroblasts: Bands also show time-dependent changes, consistent with oscillatory or damped nuclear translocation.

# Analysis :
  • The pathway diagram (A) shows a negative feedback loop where NF-κB activates its own inhibitor (IκB), enabling oscillatory or damped responses.
  • The mathematical model (B) demonstrates that feedback strength determines whether the system exhibits persistent oscillations, damped oscillations, or a monotonic rise.
  • The experimental data (C) reveal that nuclear NF-κB levels oscillate or change dynamically over time in response to stimulation in all three cell types, supporting the model’s predictions of feedback-regulated dynamics.
  • Overall, the figure integrates mechanistic, theoretical, and empirical evidence for negative feedback-driven oscillations in the NF-κB signaling pathway. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.366,t=0.541,r=0.931,b=0.890), with ID b67870b2-2a45-4dc7-b570-9ebb6c6f5e3d -->

the single-IkB isoform models in wild-type fi-
broblasts, we analyzed nuclear and cytoplasmic
extracts during TNF-α stimulation by EMSA
for NF-κBn (Fig. 2E, top) and by Western blot
for IkB proteins (Fig. 2E, lower panels). NF-
κBn first appeared within 5 minutes, as IkBα
levels rapidly decreased, and was at its max-
imum level at 30 min, when cytoplasmic IkBβ
and -ε disappeared. After 60 min, κB-binding
activity was reduced concomitantly with a tran-
sient increase in IkBα protein levels. After 2
hours, NF-κBn returned to about maximum
levels and then decreased to about half of max-
imum levels as IkBα levels stabilized and IkBβ
and -ε proteins reappeared. Model-fitting al-

rameters were about sevenfold lower than those determined for the respective single-IκB models, suggesting previously unrecognized cross-regulation in the expression of IκB genes. The outputs of the resulting “wild-type” model describe NF-κBn (Fig. 2F, top) and cellular IκB isoform levels (Fig. 2F, lower panels) in good qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimental data, thus justifying its use as a predictive tool in experimentation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.365,t=0.064,r=0.641,b=0.221), with ID 0daa9d57-b0b5-4bba-82ae-068fd1123cc7 -->

We then investigated how transient stimuli control NF-κB activation. Simulated short pulses led to transient NF-κB activation responses, whose duration was insensitive to the duration of the stimulus within the first hour (Fig. 3A). Measuring NF-κBn in transiently stimulated cells confirmed this prediction: TNF-α pulses of 5, 15, 30, and 60 min led to DNA binding activity profiles of sim- <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.366,t=0.222,r=0.641,b=0.341), with ID 2fba377f-671f-45ef-b2e2-6fb59b3b48de -->

persistently stimulated NF-κB activity (Fig.
3B). To explore the signal-processing char-
acteristics of the IκB–NF-κB signaling mod-
ule, we considered the availability of NF-κBn
for binding to an arbitrary κB-responsive pro-
moter. We plotted the duration of NF-κBn
availability above an arbitrarily chosen
threshold concentration presumed to allow
for efficient binding of the κB element of
some promoters (Fig. 3C) as a function of the
duration of TNF-α stimulation. For long
stimulations, NF-κBn lasts as long as the
stimulus. For stimulations of less than 1 hour,
the duration of the response is largely invari-

One implication of the above-described temporal regulatory switch is that some NF-
κB–responsive genes might be efficiently ac-
tivated by a stimulation pulse as short as 15
min (Fig. 4A, blue stippled line). However,
there may be other genes that require longer
(>1 hour) exposure to NF-κB. We tested this
hypothesis by examining the behavior of two
NF-κB–regulated genes that display different
transcriptional activation profiles (3). One
gene encodes the chemokine IP-10, which
displays detectable mRNA levels within 30
min of TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 4B) (14). A
15-min pulse of TNF-α was sufficient to
activate IP-10 transcription, although, as
might be expected, persistent stimulation
yielded greater amounts of IP-10 mRNA at
later time points. In contrast, the chemokine
gene RANTES required at least 2 hours of
stimulation for detectable expression and was
not induced by a shorter, transient stimulation
(Fig. 4B). The model predicts that in cells
lacking IκBα, NF-κB will have a longer nu-
clear lifetime after a short TNF-α pulse (Fig.
4A, red lines) than in wild-type cells. Indeed,
transient stimulation led to an extended peak
of κB-binding activity, similar to responses
resulting from longer stimulations (compare
upper panels in Fig. 4, B and C). In turn,
RANTES gene transcription was induced not
only with persistent stimulation but also with
transient stimulation as short as 15 min in
IκBα–/– cells (Fig. 4C). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.073,t=0.143,r=0.351,b=0.579), with ID 514a463d-eef3-4ee4-b9a4-4a377bc41d02 -->

Thus, the bimodal temporal signal-processing characteristics of the IκB–NF-κB
module result in not only quantitative but also
qualitative regulation of gene expression defining two classes of genes: those that require
persistent NF-κB activation and those that do
not. The latter genes (e.g., IP-10) undergo a
standard activation program irrespective of
the precise duration of a transient TNF-α
stimulus. IκB–NF-κB signal processing ensures that even very short stimulations can
produce easily detectable transcriptional activation of such genes. Conversely, the former
genes (e.g., RANTES) may or may not require expression of NF-κB–induced transcription factors with which NF-κB must
synergize for gene induction. RANTES induction is protein synthesis–independent (3),
and although the mechanism for the apparent
delay in RANTES induction is unknown, it is
noteworthy that histone H4 acetylation in
macrophages was shown to be lipopolysaccharide-inducible on the RANTES promoter
while it was constitutive on many other chemokine promoters (20). If H4 acetylation, a
marker for chromatin accessibility, precedes
NF-κB binding to the endogenous promoter,
it may be induced by a NF-κB–independent <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.074,t=0.580,r=0.350,b=0.951), with ID 1eaef895-677f-41bd-bde8-f87c128875b4 -->

  • The relationship between stimulus duration and response duration is nonlinear, with diminishing returns for very short pulses and a more linear increase at longer durations.
  • EMSA data confirm model predictions: longer TNF-α pulses yield more sustained NF-κB nuclear presence.
  • The system acts as a temporal filter, with a threshold effect for short stimuli and proportional response for longer ones. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.364,t=0.255,r=0.933,b=0.540), with ID 8f746b78-df89-43e4-89b0-fdec8428baf4 -->

Schwann cells in developing and regenerating peripheral nerves express elevated levels of the neurotrophin receptor p75^NTR^. Neurotrophins are key mediators of peripheral nervous system myelination. Our results show that myelin formation is inhibited in the absence of functional p75^NTR^ and enhanced by blocking TrkC activity. Moreover, the enhancement of myelin formation by endogenous brain-derived neurotrophic factor is mediated by the p75^NTR^ receptor, whereas TrkC receptors are responsible for neurotrophin-3 inhibition. Thus p75^NTR^ and TrkC receptors have opposite effects on myelination. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.110,t=0.380,r=0.608,b=0.516), with ID 2da2450e-ab52-4fca-9c3a-36b5c651ebe7 -->

The neurotrophin receptor p75^NTR^ (1) is now known to have more diverse functions than that of being a helper for the Trk receptors. We show that the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) acts through p75^NTR^ to enhance myelin formation.

The myelin sheath is a specialized mem-
brane component in the nervous system that
maximizes the conduction efficiency and ve-
locity of neuronal action potentials. The
myelination program involves a number of
signals between the neuronal and myelin-
forming cells that include, in the peripheral
nervous system (PNS), neuregulins (5), adeno-
sine triphosphate (6), steroid hormones (7),
Desert hedgehog (8), and the neurotrophins
BDNF and NT3 (9). Removal of BDNF in-
hibited myelination, whereas removal of NT3
enhanced myelination in vitro and in vivo (9). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.655,t=0.341,r=0.932,b=0.513), with ID 290f40b7-c42f-4ad3-a15d-621288f7a7d2 -->

To identify the neurotrophin receptors re-
sponsible, we determined which receptor mR-
NAs were present during myelination both in
sciatic nerve and in Schwann cell/dorsal root
ganglia neuron (SC/DRG) cocultures by non-
quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR). The mRNAs for
p75^NTR^ and TrkC-TK^+^ were present in both
actively myelinating sciatic nerve and cocul-
tures (Fig. 1A). TrkB-T1 mRNA was also
detected in sciatic nerve and in cocultures,
whereas only a minute amount of TrkB-FL was
observed. Myelination in the sciatic nerve, de-
termined by the expression of the major myelin <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.655,t=0.513,r=0.933,b=0.700), with ID 36f0b214-c2df-4a0c-acff-b4be3e407700 -->

Summary : This figure demonstrates the expression of neurotrophin receptors (p75^NTR, TrkB, TrkC), myelin proteins (P0, PMP22), and ribosomal protein L19 during development in sciatic nerve and Schwann cell/dorsal root ganglion (SC/DRG) cocultures, using RT-PCR and Western blot analyses, and quantifies their temporal expression patterns.

western blot and line chart:
# Panel A: Western Blot Analysis :
  • Samples: DRG, SC, SC/DRG 0 days, SC/DRG 4 days, sciatic nerve, brain.
  • Proteins detected: L19, PMP22, p75^NTR, TrkB-FL, TrkB-T1, TrkB-T2, TrkC-TK+.
  • Each protein is shown as a horizontal band for each sample, indicating presence/absence and relative abundance.

# Panel B: Line Charts of Protein Expression :
  • Two panels: "SC/DRG Cocultures" (left) and "Sciatic Nerve" (right).
  • Y-axis: "Protein expression (% of maximum)".
  • X-axis (left): "Days after induction" (range: -4 to 12).
  • X-axis (right): "Age (days)" (range: 0 to 20, plus "Adult").
  • Four series in each panel:
    – P0 (solid circles)
    – p75^NTR (solid squares)
    – TrkB-T1 (open triangles)
    – TrkC-TK+ (solid triangles)
  • Data points are plotted with error bars (mean ± SD).

# Data Points :
  • SC/DRG Cocultures:
    – P0: Low before induction, rises sharply after day 0, peaks around day 8–10.
    – p75^NTR: High before induction, declines after day 0.
    – TrkB-T1: Low before induction, increases after day 0, peaks around day 8–10.
    – TrkC-TK+: Low before induction, increases after day 0, peaks around day 8–10.
  • Sciatic Nerve:
    – P0: Low at birth (P0), increases with age, peaks in adulthood.
    – p75^NTR: High at birth, decreases with age.
    – TrkB-T1: Low at birth, increases with age.
    – TrkC-TK+: Low at birth, increases with age.

# Design Encodings :
  • Distinct markers for each protein (solid circles, squares, open triangles, solid triangles).
  • Error bars represent standard deviation.
  • Two separate panels for in vitro (SC/DRG cocultures) and in vivo (sciatic nerve) data.

# Analysis :
  • Myelin protein P0 and neurotrophin receptors TrkB-T1 and TrkC-TK+ are upregulated during myelination in both SC/DRG cocultures and sciatic nerve, with expression peaking after induction or with age.
  • p75^NTR shows the opposite trend, being high before myelination and decreasing as myelination progresses.
  • The temporal expression patterns are similar in vitro and in vivo, supporting the use of SC/DRG cocultures as a model for peripheral nerve development.
  • The Western blot confirms the presence of these proteins in the relevant tissues and developmental stages. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.072,t=0.709,r=0.936,b=0.952), with ID a97dba6a-9869-442a-b7c1-51721401b009 -->

Reports: “The IκB–NF-κB signaling module: Temporal control and selective gene activation” by A. Hoffmann, _et al._ (8 November 2002, p. 1241). It has come to our attention that Fig. 3B may give the appearance that lanes were spliced or possibly duplicated. The experiments that yielded this figure were carried out in 1997 using autoradiography when the authors were at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Similar experiments were rerun after the authors had moved to the California Institute of Technology. Because more stringent standards for handling electronic images have arisen more recently [see, e.g., M. Rossner, K. M. Yamada, _J. Cell Biol._ **166**, 11 (2004)], we provide a recently created figure based on data from a similar experiment (top), as well as an image of the full gel (bottom) captured with a Molecular Dynamics Phosphoimager. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.210,t=0.249,r=0.784,b=0.408), with ID 4e35b4f8-bba1-44a6-8b64-99a4ab9e9632 -->

Summary : This figure shows a time-course analysis of DNA-protein binding activity using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) with nuclear extracts incubated with different TNF promoter (TNFp) probes at various time points after stimulation, as well as a TNF coding region (TNFc) control.

gel image:
  Labels & Lanes :
    • Rows (left labels): TNFp 5’, TNFp 15’, TNFp 30’, TNFp 60’, TNFc.
    • Columns (top labels): -, 10’, 30’, 1, 90’, 2, 3 hr (presumably minutes and hours after stimulation).
    • Each cell contains a vertical lane showing band intensity.
  Experimental Design :
    • Each row represents a different DNA probe (TNF promoter at different positions or coding region).
    • Each column represents a different time point after stimulation.
    • The "-" lane is the unstimulated control.
    • The presence and intensity of shifted bands indicate DNA-protein complex formation.
  Band Patterns :
    • TNFp 5’, 15’, 30’, and 60’ rows show strong bands at 10’, 30’, and 1 (presumably 1 hr), with band intensity decreasing at later time points (90’, 2, 3 hr).
    • TNFc row shows faint or no bands across all time points, indicating little or no binding.

Analysis :
  • DNA-protein binding activity at the TNF promoter is rapidly induced after stimulation, peaking between 10 and 60 minutes, and then declines by 90 minutes to 3 hours.
  • The TNF coding region (TNFc) does not show significant binding, serving as a negative control.
  • The temporal pattern suggests transient activation of DNA-binding proteins at the TNF promoter following stimulation. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.218,t=0.415,r=0.516,b=0.593), with ID fcf756e3-8c93-418d-b089-dd9c6621cddc -->

Summary : This image shows an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) gel, comparing DNA-protein binding patterns at various time points after TNF (tumor necrosis factor) pulse or chronic TNF treatment.

gel electrophoresis:
# Experimental Conditions :
  • Five main groups, each labeled above the lanes: "TNFp 5’", "TNFp 15’", "TNFp 30’", "TNFp 60’", and "TNF chronic".
  • Each group contains lanes labeled: "-", "10’", "30’", "1", "90’", "2", "3" (with "hr" for the last group).
  • These labels likely represent time points (in minutes or hours) after TNF treatment or pulse.

# Gel Bands :
  • Each lane contains several horizontal bands of varying intensity.
  • The bottom-most band is very dark and consistent across all lanes, likely representing free probe.
  • Multiple higher bands are visible, with intensities and patterns that change across time points and conditions.
  • The number and intensity of shifted bands (above the free probe) vary between groups and time points.

# Design Encodings :
  • Black and white image (grayscale).
  • Lanes are separated by white vertical lines for clarity.
  • No color or additional markers.

# Analysis :
  • The presence and intensity of shifted bands (above the free probe) change over time and between TNF pulse and chronic TNF conditions.
  • Early time points (e.g., TNFp 5’) show less intense or fewer shifted bands, while later time points and chronic TNF show more pronounced shifts.
  • The consistent bottom band across all lanes serves as a loading or probe control.
  • The pattern suggests dynamic changes in DNA-protein complex formation in response to TNF stimulation, with differences between acute pulse and chronic exposure. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.217,t=0.614,r=0.922,b=0.862), with ID d9f73943-b109-494f-a54a-90ae199d87f2 -->
