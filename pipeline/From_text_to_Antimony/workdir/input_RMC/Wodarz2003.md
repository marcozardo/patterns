## Summary

Memory is a central characteristic of immune re-
sponses [1]. It is defined as an elevated number of
specific immune cells that remain after resolution of
infection and can protect the host against reinfection
[2]. The evolution of immunological memory is subject
to debate [3-7]. The advantages of memory discussed
so far include protection from reinfection, control of
chronic infection, and the transfer of immune function
to the next generation. Mathematical models are used
to identify a new force that can drive the evolution of
immunological memory: the duration of memory can
regulate the degree of competition between different
pathogens. While a long duration of memory provides
lasting protection against reinfection, it may also allow
an inferior pathogen species to persist. This can be
detriments for the host if the inferior pathogen is more
virulent. On the other hand, a shorter duration of mem-
ory ensures that an inferior pathogen species is ex-
cluded. This can be beneficial for the host if the inferior
pathogen is more virulent. Thus, while in the absence
of pathogen diversity memory is always expected to
evolve to a long duration, under specific circum-
stances, memory can evolve toward shorter durations
in the presence of pathogen diversity.

## Results and Discussion

This paper examines the evolution of immunological memory, defined as the duration for which hosts are protected from reinfection. This is investigated with mathematical models. They are based on previous epidemiological work [8] and take into account susceptible, infected, and recovered/immune hosts (Figure 1). In the model, immune hosts revert to being susceptible at a rate g; the duration of memory is thus given by G = 1/g. First, consider the simplest scenario where a single pathogen population interacts with a host population (Figure 1A). Mathematical analysis clearly shows that a longer duration of memory is always advantageous for the host. In the model, the duration of memory is predicted to evolve to infinity (G = ∞), but in reality it would of course be finite, determined by reproductive tradeoffs not included in the model. We refer to this as the maximum memory outcome. Now, consider a more complicated scenario, which describes the interactions between two pathogen species or strains [9, 10] that compete for one host population (Figure 1B). An impor-

<a id='faeb406f-cc06-434c-a97a-e80bc60c1089'></a>

tant assumption is that the two pathogen species or strains are not immunologically crossreactive. Therefore, hosts recovered from one pathogen are still susceptible to infection by the other. In the following, the evolution of memory under these assumptions is investigated.

<a id='a353c7b9-405f-4c9f-a206-fd9ec6bcc4d5'></a>

The model gives rise to the interesting finding that the
duration of memory (G) can regulate the outcome of
competition between the two pathogens (Figure 2). If
the duration of memory is short and the population of
immune hosts becomes susceptible again at a fast rate
(low value of G), competition between pathogens is
strong and the superior pathogen wins and excludes
the inferior one. On the other hand, if the duration of
protection is longer (higher value of G), competition
between the two pathogens is weaker and coexistence
of the pathogens can be observed (Figure 2). The longer
the duration of protection, the higher the relative abun-
dance of the competitively inferior pathogen (Figure 2).
In other words, long-lasting immunological memory
allows a competitively inferior pathogen to persist and
to be maintained in the host population. The reason is
as follows. A long duration of memory results in the
presence of hosts that are susceptible to only one and
not the other pathogen species. Therefore, the degree
of interspecific competition is reduced relative to intra-
specific competition. This results in coexistence. If, on
the other hand, the duration of memory is relatively
short, then the majority of hosts will be susceptible to
both pathogen species. In this case, the degree of inter-
specific competition is much higher and competitive
exclusion is observed. A relationship between immunity,
crossreactivity, and pathogen diversity has been dis-
cussed before in the context of influenza virus infection
[11, 12].

What are the implications of these findings for the
evolution of immunological memory? The answer de-
pends on the assumptions of the model. If the inferior
pathogen species is less virulent, persistence of this
pathogen due to a longer duration of memory can only
be advantageous for the host. The situation is, however,
more complicated if the inferior pathogen is more viru-
lent. In this case, the persistence of the inferior pathogen
due to a longer duration of memory can be costly for
the host population because the level of virulence is
higher. From an evolutionary point of view, this is the
most interesting parameter region, and the rest of the
paper will focus on this.

In this parameter region where the inferior pathogen
is more virulent, the following arguments apply. While
a long duration of memory is advantageous because it
protects the host from reinfection, a short duration of
memory can also be advantageous because it allows
less virulent pathogens to exclude more virulent ones.
We observe two outcomes toward which the system
may evolve (Figure 3). One of the outcomes is maximum
memory (G = ∞). The other outcome is a suboptimal
and shorter duration of memory (smaller value of G). To
which state the system evolves depends on the starting

(A) Interactions between a single pathogen population and a host population. The model takes into account the following basic variables: susceptible and uninfected hosts, S; infected hosts, I; recovered hosts that are protected against reinfection, R; and a population of pathogens, P. Uninfected and susceptible hosts are assumed to reproduce at a rate r and die at a rate d. They become infected by the pathogen at a rate ̘. Infected hosts are characterized by an elevated death rate, a, reflecting pathogen-induced mortality. In addition, they are assumed to recover from infection at a rate ̘. Recovered hosts die at the same rate as uninfected individuals, d, and they cannot be reinfected by the pathogen. This protection is not infinite, but is lost at a rate g. The model assumes that all host populations reproduce. The pathogen is, however, not transmitted vertically to the offspring. Moreover, it is assumed that offspring from recovered and immune hosts are once again susceptible to infection. (While antibody memory can be transferred from mother to child, this protection only lasts for a few months; T cell memory is not transferred from mother to offspring). Finally, pathogens can be released from the hosts into the environment at a rate k and may decay in the environment at a rate u. The dynamics are formulated in terms of ordinary differential equations that describe the development of these populations over time. The equations are given in the Supplemental Data.

(B) Interactions between two pathogen populations and a host. The model includes two populations of pathogens, P₁ and P₂. The population of hosts infected with pathogen 1 are denoted by I₁, and hosts recovered and immune to pathogen 1 are denoted by R₁. Similarly, hosts infected by pathogen 2 are denoted by I₂, and hosts recovered and immune to pathogen 2 are denoted by R₂. Hosts immune to pathogen 1 are still susceptible to pathogen 2, and hosts immune to pathogen 2 are susceptible to pathogen 1. Thus, we have the following additional populations: hosts recovered from pathogen 1 and infected with pathogen 2, I₁₂; hosts recovered from pathogen 2 and infected with pathogen 1, I₂₁; and hosts recovered and immune to both infections, R₁₂. For simplicity, it is assumed that hosts do not experience simultaneous multiple infections. The equations for the model are given in the Supplemental Data.

condition, G₀ (Figure 3). If we start with a duration of memory that lies above a threshold (G₀ > Gthr), the sys-tem evolves toward maximal memory. If we start with a duration of memory that lies below the threshold (G₀ < Gthr), the system evolves to the state describing subopti-mal memory. What is the initial duration of memory that separates the two outcomes (value of Gthr)? As shown in Figure 4, it depends on the rate of host killing by the more virulent pathogen. At one extreme, the rate of host killing by the more virulent pathogen is similar to that of the less virulent pathogen. Figure 4 shows that the

<a id='ac67333c-5e28-49c1-81d7-3cca1619d8f5'></a>

threshold duration (Gthr) separating the two outcomes is short. Therefore, the system is likely to evolve to maximum duration of memory. The reason is that the difference in virulence between the two pathogens is low. Thus, it does not pay to reduce memory in order to exclude the more virulent pathogen. At the opposite extreme, the rate of host killing by the more virulent pathogen is much higher than that of the less virulent one. Now, the threshold duration (Gthr) that separates the two outcomes is very high. In this case, the system is likely to evolve toward the suboptimal memory outcome.

The reason is that the more virulent pathogen is charac-terized by a much higher rate of host killing comparedto the less virulent one. It therefore confers a significantcost to the host population, and exclusion of the morevirulent pathogen by means of memory reduction con-fers a significant advantage. Note, however, that theduration of protection at the suboptimal memory out-come becomes longer as the rate of host killing by themore virulent pathogen is increased. The reason is thata higher rate of host killing reduces the relative fitnessof the more virulent pathogen, and thus less memoryreduction is required to exclude it.Note, however, that the two outcomes to which the

<a id='780d9db1-ddbc-4025-bd33-7e98cf61b4f3'></a>

system can evolve may not be stable states. Assume that evolution takes the system to the suboptimal memory outcome. This can result in the exclusion of a more virulent pathogen and reduction in pathogen diversity. As pathogen diversity is reduced, it will become advantageous again to evolve a longer duration of memory because this leads to lasting protection. As memory becomes longer, however, inferior pathogens may invade again. As a consequence, more virulent pathogens can persist and pathogen diversity increases. In this scenario, it will once again pay to evolve toward a shorter duration of memory. Thus, we may expect the duration of memory to cycle over time.

Figure 3. Schematic Representation Depicting the Evolution of Immunological Memory Assuming the Presence of Two Populations of Pathogens that Differ in Their Fitness

The pathogens differ in their virulence (rate of host killing), and we assume that we are in a parameter region where increased virulence correlates with reduced fitness. The system can evolve toward two different outcomes: the maximum memory outcome or the shorter or "suboptimal" memory outcome. Which outcome is achieved by evolution depends on the initial conditions, that is, the initial duration of memory. If the simulation is started with an initial duration of memory that lies above Gthr, having a longer duration of memory is advantageous. Thus, evolution takes the system to the maximum memory outcome. If the simulation is started with an initial duration of memory that lies below Gthr, the system evolves toward the the following reason. If the duration of memory advantageous and wins. If the duration of memory

evolution takes the system to the maximum memory outcome. If the simulation is started with an initial duration of memory that lies below G_thr, the system evolves toward the suboptimal memory outcome. The system can converge to the suboptimal memory outcome for the following reason. If the duration of memory lies below G_thr but above the suboptimal memory outcome, a shorter duration of memory is advantageous and wins. If the duration of memory lies below the suboptimal memory outcome, longer memory is advantageous and wins.

We assume that we are in a parameter region where increased virulence results in reduced fitness. Starting with a duration of memory that lies above Gthr, the system evolves to the maximum memory outcome (indicated by the arrows pointing upwards). Starting with an initial duration of memory that lies below Gthr, the system evolves to the suboptimal memory outcome that is indicated by a line. If the degree of host killing by the more virulent pathogen is similar to that of the less virulent one, Gthr is low and the system is likely to evolve to the maximum memory outcome. If the degree of host killing by the more virulent pathogen is higher, Gthr is high and the system is likely to evolve to the suboptimal memory outcome. As the degree of host killing by the more virulent pathogen is increased, the duration of memory at the suboptimal outcome becomes longer, because less memory reduction is required to exclude more virulent pathogens. Parameters were chosen as follows: r = 0.5; d = 0.01; β = 1; α = 0.03; k = 1; u = 0.5; a1 = 0.03; a2 = 1.

<a id='8d722bdc-e764-4efe-9673-20c37def8f1f'></a>

host because it can reduce pathogen diversity. The arti-
cle is concluded with a discussion of these results in
the light of immunological data. This is a challenging
task because much of the information required to link
theory and data is currently not available. In order to
test theory, the duration of protection against reinfection
needs to be measured in the context of two types of
pathogens. One pathogen needs to be genetically di-
verse and cocirculate as a collection of distinct sero-
types; the other pathogen should be homogeneous.
Based on theory, immunity against any strain/serotype
of the diverse pathogen should be shorter than protec-
tion against the homogeneous pathogen. For this to be
true, however, the following conditions need to hold:
the serotypes should be characterized by differences in
pathogenicity, and the more pathogenic strains should
have reduced fitness relative to the less pathogenic
strains. This is very difficult to quantify [13], and such
information does not currently exist to my knowledge.

Nevertheless, it is interesting to consider rhinoviruses as an example [9, 10]. Rhinoviruses, which can cause the common cold, cocirculate as a collection of many different serotypes. The primary infection results in the generation of IgA in nasal secretions and IgG in blood stream. Acquired immunity is type specific and corre- lates with the level of mucosal IgA antibodies [14]. (While other responses, such as CD8 T cells, are not necessarily type specific, their role in protection is uncertain.) The titer of IgA antibodies, however, declines at a relatively fast rate, and protection is thought to last for only one or two years [15, 16]. This is in contrast to the observa- tion that many infections, as well as vaccines, can result in the presence of protecting antibodies for decades [17]. It can be hypothesized that the shorter duration of memory is observed against rhinoviruses because it prevents the maintenance of pathogenic strains in the host population. Validation of this hypothesis would, however, require detailed investigations, as outlined above. This could have important implications for vacci- nation approaches: prolonging the duration of protec-

tion against rhinoviruses by vaccination might allow for the emergence of more pathogenic strains, resulting in a cost for the human population.

<a id='bed48466-cecf-4a1e-9e85-63a48deed7d6'></a>

It is an important question how the duration of memory can be modulated. For example, it has been observed that memory CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocytes) can persist for a very long time in the absence of antigenic stimulation [2], and this should apply to all infections. Interestingly, it has also been demonstrated that the number of memory CTL against a given pathogen can be reduced by an antigenically heterologous infection [18]. Thus, if a host is exposed to many serologically distinct pathogens in a relatively short period of time, memory against the pathogens can be reduced and might last for a shorter period of time. It is interesting to consider the hypothesis that this could be adaptive for the host: it may allow a reduction in pathogen diversity and the extinction of more pathogenic strains. Other factors can also modulate the duration of immunological memory. The interactions between pathogens and the immune system can result in the impaired generation of memory and thus in shorter protection. If shorter protection is advantageous for the host, there will be no selection pressure to overcome this impairment. On the other hand, protection can be prolonged if memory is re-boosted. This can occur if reinfection is not prevented and limited pathogen growth occurs. While symptoms may be absent, the limited pathogen growth could increase an otherwise declining memory cell population. These examples show that the duration of memory should not be considered as a fixed constant, but as a variable that can be modulated. The analysis presented here provides a framework in which to consider the topic of memory duration in more detail.
