1.  **Introduction**

Nowadays, media coverage is changing the way that we communicate with each other in our daily life and work, and the media may be the most important source of healthy messages for the general public. Meanwhile, it also plays a significant role in the spread and control of epidemic disease by providing some healthy messages because people usually express their experiences of illness [1]. In the transmission process of epidemic disease, media coverage is a key factor. Media coverage about an epidemic disease gives a sense about the risk level and encourages the people to take precautionary measures such as wearing masks, avoiding public places and traveling when sick, frequent hand washing etc., to prevent the disease.

Massive news coverage and fast information flow can generate a profound psychological impact on public health. Moreover, a research showed that three tabloids and two broadsheets sent a total of 1153 messages about SARS in Britain [2], while the New Zealand Herald sent a total of 261 messages [3] from March to July 2003 during the spread of SARS. As the number of infected individuals increases, media coverage gives more reports about healthy messages of epidemic disease and cuts down the opportunity and probability of contact transmission among the alerted susceptible individuals, which is

<::Flowchart: The flowchart illustrates the SEIS epidemic model with the impact of media. It consists of four main compartments: Susceptible (S, red square), Exposed (E, brown square), Infected (I, green square), and Media (M, grey square). An input arrow labeled 'A' points into S. Transitions between compartments are as follows: - From S to E, an arrow is labeled 'βe^(-αM)'. - From E to I, an arrow is labeled 'ρ'. - From S, an arrow points downwards labeled 'α1'. - From E, an arrow points downwards labeled 'α1'. - From I, an arrow points downwards labeled '(α1 + α2)'. - A curved arrow labeled 'γ' originates from below E and I (specifically from the paths of 'α1' and '(α1 + α2)' from E and I respectively) and points back to S. The Media (M) compartment interacts with the others: - Dashed arrows point from S to M (labeled 'μ1'), from E to M (labeled 'μ2'), and from I to M (labeled 'μ3'). - A dotted arrow points downwards from M, indicating its influence on the 'βe^(-αM)' transition. - An upward arrow labeled 'τ' points out of M.

beneficial to the control and prevention of disease for further spreading. Therefore, public-health organizations increasingly advocate for the use of all kinds of medias for their high-reach, low-cost messages dissemination potential of epidemic diseases.

Mathematical modeling has become an important tool in analyzing the spread and control of epidemic disease and is being used to indicate how the disease will spread over a period of time. Recently, many attempts have been made for investigating the transmission dynamics of epidemic disease [4-17]. Tchuenche et al. [9] studied the impact of media coverage on the spread and control of an influenza strain. Sun et al. [10] used non-linear contact rate to study media-induced social distancing in a two patch setting. Cui et al. [11] proposed a general contact rate β(I) = c₁ - c₂f(I) to reflect some intrinsic characters of media coverage. Liu et al. [12] proposed an EIH model to illustrate a possible mechanism for multiple outbreaks or even sustained periodic oscillations of emerging infectious diseases due to the psychological impact of the reported numbers of infectious and hospitalized individuals. K. Pawelek et al. [13] assumed that the disease transmission β was reduced by a factor e⁻ᵃᵀ due to the behavior change of the public after reading tweets about influenza, where α determined how effective the disease information could influence the transmission rate. Their results showed that twitter might serve as a good indicator of seasonal influenza epidemics. Huo et al. [14] mainly studied the SEI model with the influence of positive and negative information of twitter. Their results showed that the impact posed by the negative information of twitter was not significant than the impact posed by the positive information of twitter on influenza.

Motivated by the documents [12-14], the goal of the present paper is to construct a more realistic SEIS epidemic model with the impact of media, in which we assume that infected people are temporary immunity and consider the effect of the natural and the disease-related death rates. The occurrence of a forward, backward and Hopf bifurcation is derived. Our results manifest that media can regard as a good indicator in controlling the emergence and spread of the epidemic disease.

<a id='6f6c8edc-aebc-4fc5-8816-e0d5197f9780'></a>

The remain part of this paper is organized in the following: In Section 2, we introduce a new _SEIS_ epidemic model with the impact of media. In Section 3, we calculate the basic reproductive number, and prove the stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria. A forward, backward and Hopf bifurcation are also investigated in this section. In Section 4, we carry out some numerical simulations. In Section 5, we perform sensitivity analysis on a few parameters. In the last section, we make some discussions.

## 2. Mathematical model

### 2.1. System description

The total population is divided into three compartments: S(t), E(t), I(t). S(t) represents the number of susceptible individuals; E(t) represents the number of individuals exposed to the infected but unable to infect others; I(t) represents the number of infected individuals who can infect other people. M(t) represents the number of message that all of them provide about epidemic disease at time t, respectively. Since we consider the disease outbreak in the long time, we do not neglect the natural and the disease-related death rates. Further we assume that the susceptible individuals has a recruitment rate A. The total number of population at time t is given by

<a id='a2bb9a0b-eaa1-4b37-96ea-fb880b13afe4'></a>

N(t) = S(t) + E(t) + I(t).
The model structure is shown in Fig. 1.
The transfer diagram leads to the following system of ordinary differential equations:

Ṡ = A + γI − βSIe⁻ᵃᴹ − α₁S,
Ė = βSIe⁻ᵃᴹ − ρE − α₁E,
İ = ρE − γI − (α₁ + α₂)I,
Ṁ = μ₁S + μ₂E + μ₃I − τM,

where α₁ is the natural death rate; α₂ is the disease-related death rate; We assume that all the people may send the message about epidemic disease at the rates μ₁, μ₂, and μ₃, respectively, during an epidemic season. β is the transmission rate between the susceptible individuals and the infected individuals, but owing to the behavior change of the public after reading messages about epidemic disease, the disease transmission rate β is reduced by a factor e⁻ᵃᴹ; α determines how effective the disease-related messages can influence the transmission rate; ρ is transmission coefficient from the exposed individuals to the infected individuals; γ is the transmission rate from the infected people to the susceptible people; τ is the rate that messages become outdated.

2.2. Basic properties
To show that the model (2.1) is epidemiologically meaningful, we will prove that all variables of system (2.1) are non-negative for all time t > 0. We thus have the following **Lemmas**.

<a id='281b4a04-1ccb-436f-9f68-d20afe45e109'></a>

2.2.1. Positivity of solutions

**Lemma 2.2.1.** If S(0) ≥ 0, E(0) ≥ 0, I(0) ≥ 0, and M(0) ≥ 0, the solutions S(t), E(t), I(t), and M(t) of system (2.1) with initial conditions S(0) ≥ 0, E(0) ≥ 0, I(0) ≥ 0, M(0) ≥ 0 are positive for all t > 0.

<a id='f8edb354-5242-43bb-ab06-2b8b350830e8'></a>

**Proof.** If S(0) ≥ 0, according to the first equation of system (2.1), we have,

```
d(S(t))
------ = A + γI(t) − βS(t)I(t)e−αM(t) − α₁S(t).
dt
```

<a id='e2a2d1fc-7741-41fb-9956-30714005eaa1'></a>

It can be rewritten as:

$\frac{d(S(t))}{dt} \exp \left\{ \int_{0}^{t} (\beta I(\tau)e^{-\alpha M(\tau)} + \alpha_1) d\tau \right\}$

$+ S(t)(\beta I(t)e^{-\alpha M(t)} + \alpha_1) \exp \left\{ \int_{0}^{t} (\beta I(\tau)e^{-\alpha M(\tau)} + \alpha_1) d\tau \right\}$

$= (A + \gamma I(t)) \exp \left\{ \int_{0}^{t} (\beta I(\tau)e^{-\alpha M(\tau)} + \alpha_1) d\tau \right\} .$

<a id='1074357f-6346-4f14-be10-51980da4a615'></a>

Thus,
d/dt (S(t)exp {∫_0^t (βI(τ)e^(-αM(τ)) + α_1)dτ})
= (A + γI(t))exp {∫_0^t (βI(τ)e^(-αM(τ)) + α_1)dτ}.

<a id='676976b5-4d6f-4330-9e44-be5711066bfe'></a>

And then,

<a id='f065df72-b734-4177-8e00-3d7a89e6f002'></a>

S(t)exp { ∫₀ᵗ (βI(τ)e⁻ᵃᴹ(τ) + α₁) dτ } - S(0)
= ∫₀ᵗ ((A + γI(τ))exp { ∫₀ʳ (βI(μ)e⁻ᵃᴹ(μ) + α₁) dμ }) dτ.

<a id='c8ccc9ac-d7d3-4935-aa1f-22171cbb925b'></a>

Hence,

<a id='c916eb3c-45ea-4d5e-aba9-2451845952a9'></a>

S(t) = S(0)exp { - \int_{0}^{t} (\beta I(\tau)e^{-\alpha M(\tau)} + \alpha_{1})d\tau }
+ exp { - \int_{0}^{t} (\beta I(\tau)e^{-\alpha M(\tau)} + \alpha_{1})d\tau }
\times \left( \int_{0}^{t} \left( (A + \gamma I(\tau))exp \left\{ \int_{0}^{\tau} (\beta I(\mu)e^{-\alpha M(\mu)} + \alpha_{1})d\mu \right\} \right)d\tau \right)
> 0.

<a id='03e93975-53b9-4010-a1b8-72c1a76d1bad'></a>

Similarly, we can prove that $E(t) > 0$, $I(t) > 0$, $M(t) > 0$. So the solutions $S(t)$, $E(t)$, $I(t)$, $M(t)$ of system (2.1) with initial conditions $S(0) \ge 0$, $E(0) \ge 0$, $I(0) \ge 0$, $M(0) \ge 0$ are positive for all $t > 0$. This completes the proof of Lemma 2.2.1. □

2.2.2. Invariant region

<a id='1da34cc6-2b5a-45b4-bee9-40ed14275d7a'></a>

**Lemma 2.2.2.** The attracting region Ω defined by

Ω = {(S, E, I, M) ∈ R₄⁺ : 0 ≤ S, E, I ≤ N ≤ A/α₁, 0 ≤ M ≤ A(μ₁ + μ₂ + μ₃)/(τα₁)}

with initial conditions S(0) ≥ 0, E(0) ≥ 0, I(0) ≥ 0, M(0) ≥ 0 and attracting all solutions initiating in the interior of the positive orthant is positive invariant for system (2.1).

<a id='f5aa8693-9a5e-4762-b8f9-062f388a3fb5'></a>

Proof. Primarily, adding the former third equations of system (2.1), we have,
dN
-- = A - α₁N - α₂I ≤ A - α₁N.
dt
It follows that,

      A
0 ≤ N ≤ --- + N(0)e^(-α₁t),
     α₁

<a id='288d3bcf-b6aa-4151-add0-2ea95a80c674'></a>

where $N(0)$ represents the initial value of the total population. Therefore, $\lim \sup_{t\to\infty}N \leq \frac{A}{\alpha_1}$.
Next, according to the fourth equation of system (2.1), we get,

$\frac{dM}{dt} \leq \frac{(\mu_1 + \mu_2 + \mu_3)A}{\alpha_1} - \tau M$,

and then,

$0 \leq M \leq \frac{(\mu_1 + \mu_2 + \mu_3)A}{\tau\alpha_1} + M(0)e^{-\tau t}$,

<a id='ac48c5cb-a04b-4d7e-819c-51456f6f2d57'></a>

where $M(0)$ represents the initial value of the message of media. Thus, $\lim \sup_{t\to\infty} M \le \frac{(\mu_1+\mu_2+\mu_3)\Lambda}{\tau\alpha_1}$. Throughout this paper,
we will consider dynamics of system (2.1) on the region $\Omega$. This completes the proof of Lemma 2.2.2. \square

## 3. Analysis of the model

### 3.1. Disease-free equilibrium and the basic reproductive number

Let the right-hand sides of Eq. (2.1) equal zero, we have,

```
{ A + γI – βSIe^{-αM} – α₁S = 0,
{ βSIe^{-αM} – ρE – α₁E = 0,
{ ρE – γI – (α₁ + α₂)I = 0,
{ μ₁S + μ₂E + μ₃I – τM = 0.
```
(3.1)

<a id='d58678fc-5916-4fad-a812-79e233103313'></a>

Meanwhile, let $E = I = 0$ in Eq. (3.1), it is straightforward to see that the model has a disease-free equilibrium given by the following:

$$ P_0 = (S_0, 0, 0, M_0) = \left(\frac{A}{\alpha_1}, 0, 0, \frac{\mu_1 A}{\alpha_1 \tau}\right) \quad (3.2) $$


<a id='0300733b-c8b9-4116-bb23-77ed0882a5c2'></a>

Next, we will obtain the basic reproductive number R₀ of the system (2.1) by using the next-generation method [18,19].
Here, we have the following matrix of new infection 𝓕(x), and the matrix of transfer 𝓥(x). Let x = (S, E, I, M)ᵀ, then system
(2.1) can be rewritten as:

dx/dt = 𝓕(x) - 𝓥(x),

<a id='e49e47be-4ae6-430b-9215-6a4d7923eb36'></a>

where

$F(x) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \beta SIe^{-\alpha M} \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$,

$V(x) = \begin{pmatrix} \beta SIe^{-\alpha M} + \alpha_1 S - A - \gamma I \\ \rho E + \alpha_1 E \\ \gamma I + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)I - \rho E \\ \tau M - \mu_1 S - \mu_2 E - \mu_3 I \end{pmatrix}$.

<a id='960f6edd-d2f5-4694-9595-a5e8f9e90ba6'></a>

The Jacobian matrices of F(x) and V(x) at the disease-free equilibrium P₀ respectively are,

DF(P₀) =

$\text{DV}(P_0)^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{1}{\alpha_1} & -\frac{\rho(\beta S_0 e^{-\alpha M_0} - \gamma)}{\alpha_1(\alpha_1 + \rho)(\gamma + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2)} & -\frac{\beta S_0 e^{-\alpha M_0} - \gamma}{\alpha_1(\gamma + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2)} \\ 0 & \frac{1}{\alpha_1 + \rho} & 0 \\ 0 & \frac{\rho}{(\alpha_1 + \rho)(\gamma + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2)} & \frac{1}{\gamma + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2} \\ \frac{\mu_1}{\tau\alpha_1} & \frac{\alpha_1(\rho\mu_3 + \mu_2(\gamma + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2)) - \mu_1\rho(\beta S_0 e^{-\alpha M_0} - \gamma)}{\tau\alpha_1(\alpha_1 + \rho)(\gamma + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2)} & \frac{\alpha_1\mu_3(\alpha_1 + \rho) - \mu_1(\alpha_1 + \rho)(\beta S_0 e^{-\alpha M_0} - \gamma)}{\tau\alpha_1(\alpha_1 + \rho)(\gamma + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2)} \end{pmatrix}$

<a id='6dfa2c66-25fe-40d8-b2f2-91d0bb793718'></a>

Therefore, the basic reproductive number R₀ is

R₀ = ρ(DF(P₀)DV(P₀)⁻¹) = max(|λ|; λ ∈ σ(DF(P₀)DV(P₀)⁻¹)) (3.3)

<a id='b8371ec5-79d3-4bb8-ab1f-79f7d42258cf'></a>

where ρ(·) and σ(·) denote the spectral radius and the set of eigenvalues of a matrix, respectively, because it can be verified that system (2.1) satisfies hypotheses (A1)–(A5) of **Theorem 2** of [18], then, the basic reproductive number denoted by R₀ is thus given by

<a id='c21ea5d3-95e6-45b1-a698-d3046b93d540'></a>

R_0 = \frac{\beta\rho Ae^{\frac{\alpha\mu_1 A}{\alpha_1 \tau}}}{\alpha_1(\alpha_1 + \rho)(\gamma + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2)} (3.4)

<a id='e3826c3f-32a1-4077-8578-24c35243c188'></a>

Define

$R_{01} = \frac{A\rho\Theta}{(\alpha_1 + \rho)(\alpha_2 + \gamma + \alpha_1) - \rho\gamma}$ (3.5)

<a id='2d39652a-f4d1-4f27-a0ef-25bb76a1fd11'></a>

$\mathcal{R}_p = \mathcal{R}_{01}e^{1-\mathcal{R}_{01}}$ (3.6)

<a id='310e48e8-71c0-4f44-99e1-3ab218002bcf'></a>

where

$\Theta = \frac{-\alpha}{\alpha_1\rho\tau} (\mu_1\rho\gamma - \mu_1 (\alpha_1 + \rho) (\gamma + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2) + \alpha_1\mu_2(\gamma + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2) + \alpha_1\mu_3\rho)$. (3.7)

<a id='4f48fefc-b132-4323-853a-2b8b86a2dd65'></a>

Remark 3.1.1. It is clear to check that: $\mathcal{R}_{01} > 0$ if and only if $\Theta > 0$; $\mathcal{R}_{01} = 0$ if and only if $\Theta = 0$; $\mathcal{R}_{01} < 0$ if and only if $\Theta < 0$.

3.2. _Stability of disease-free equilibrium_

<a id='00538709-fa1d-47e6-ac0d-01d52f14c3db'></a>

**Theorem 3.2.1.** *Disease-free equilibrium P₀ of the system (2.1) is globally asymptotically stable if R₀ < 1, and is unstable if R₀ > 1.*

<a id='6765f313-735e-4edb-a255-70a29ec81382'></a>

Proof. The characteristic equation system (2.1) at the disease-free equilibrium P₀ is

$$\begin{vmatrix}
\lambda + \alpha_1 & 0 & \frac{\beta A}{\alpha_1}e^{-\frac{\alpha\mu_1 A}{\alpha_1\tau}} - \gamma & 0 \\
0 & \lambda + (\alpha_1 + \rho) & -\frac{\beta A}{\alpha_1}e^{-\frac{\alpha\mu_1 A}{\alpha_1\tau}} & 0 \\

then,

(λ + α₁) (λ + τ) (((λ + (α₁ + ρ))(λ + (γ + α₁ + α₂))) - (ρβA / α₁) e^(-(αμ₁A / (α₁τ)))) = 0. (3.9)

<a id='0dedf28c-2b69-43de-a001-8e139469563c'></a>

Thus, the two eigenvalues of Eq. (3.9) are λ₁ = -μ, λ₂ = -τ and the other are determined by

<a id='3944dbe7-34d2-4ce4-a1a3-17d114a57fd6'></a>

(λ + (α₁ + ρ))(λ + (γ + α₁ + α₂)) - \frac{ρβA}{α₁}e^{-\frac{αμ₁A}{α₁τ}} = 0.                                                                 (3.10)

<a id='9351a2ef-1ad4-4417-afff-3582dc71845b'></a>

Due to the expression of R₀ (3.4), the above equation can be rewritten as:
λ² + (γ + ρ + α₂ + 2α₁)λ + (α₁ + ρ)(α₂ + γ + α₁)(1 - R₀) = 0. (3.11)

Therefore, when R₀ < 1, diseased-free equilibrium P₀ is locally asymptotically stable; when R₀ > 1, diseased-free equilibrium P₀ is unstable.
Next, we define a Lyapunov function

<a id='4f472911-4ba4-4fea-834b-69a518dae41b'></a>

V(S, E, I, M) = e^(-(αμ₁A)/(α₁τ)) ρE(t) + (α₁ + ρ)I(t).

<a id='bace920a-cf7f-4b3b-9e91-59253104ca9a'></a>

It is obvious that $V(S, E, I, M) \ge 0$ and the equality holds if and only if $E(t) = I(t) = 0$. Differentiating $V(S, E, I, M)$ and using the expression of $R_0$ (3.4), we obtain,

Thus, R₀ ≤ 1 guarantees that dV(S,E,I,M)/dt ≤ 0 for all t ≥ 0, and it follows that V(S, E, I, M) is bounded and non-increasing.
Therefore, limₜ→∞V(S, E, I, M) exists. By LaSalle's Invariance Principle [20], the disease-free equilibrium P₀ is globally asymptotic stability when R₀ < 1. This completes the proof of Theorem 3.2.1. □

3.3. Existence of endemic equilibria

<a id='eca8b22d-06ea-4c29-a284-95eec12270c5'></a>

**Theorem 3.3.1.** The system (2.1) has:
(i) A unique positive endemic equilibrium P1*, when R0 > max (1, R01);
(ii) A unique positive endemic equilibrium P2*, when Rp = R0 < min (1, R01);
(iii) Two different positive endemic equilibria P3* and P4*, when Rp < R0 < min (1, R01).

where $\mathcal{R}_0$, $\mathcal{R}_{01}$, $\mathcal{R}_p$, and $\Theta$ are given by (3.4)–(3.7), and $P_i^* = (S_i^*, E_i^*, I_i^*, M_i^*)$ (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) meet (3.13)–(3.15).

<a id='12639c60-7c9c-4e7a-8663-55e23bda7078'></a>

Proof. We assume that P* = (S*, E*, I*, M*) is a solution of Eq. (3.1), that is,

$$\begin{cases}
A + \gamma I^* - \beta S^* I^* e^{-\alpha M^*} - \alpha_1 S^* = 0, \\
\beta S^* I^* e^{-\alpha M^*} - \rho E^* - \alpha_1 E^* = 0, \\
\rho E^* - \gamma I^* - (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)I^* = 0, \\
\mu_1 S^* + \mu_2 E^* + \mu_3 I^* - \tau M^* = 0.
\end{cases}\quad(3.12)$$

<a id='84d53e5a-d08e-4645-9114-40bb5fff1731'></a>

Next, we suppose that S*, E*, M* are the linear function in regard to I* respectively. We obtain,

S* = A/α1 + (γ/α1 - (α1 + ρ)(α2 + γ + α1) / (α1ρ))I*                                                                           (3.13)

E* = (γ + α1 + α2)I* / ρ                                                                                                               (3.14)

$$(1 - (\frac{(\alpha_1 + \rho)(\alpha_2 + \gamma + \alpha_1)}{A\rho}) - \frac{\gamma}{A}) I^* R_0 = e^{-\Theta I^*} \quad (3.16)$$

<a id='fb53730f-721d-4b43-b485-aa9043b80824'></a>

By (3.5) and (3.16), we have,

$R_0 - \frac{R_0}{R_{01}} \Theta I^* - e^{-\Theta I^*} = 0.$ (3.17)

<a id='861cec90-d020-495c-b5e3-5bc914bf295f'></a>

We denote,
H(I) = R₀ - R₀/R₀₁ (ΘI - e^(-ΘI)) . (3.18)

<a id='0ff63688-e8f3-4f66-b007-494b540b0fda'></a>

By (3.18), we can get,

H(0) = R₀ - 1, H(∞) = -∞, H'(I) = - R₀ / R₀₁ Θ + Θe⁻ᴵ

H'(0) = - R₀ / R₀₁ Θ + Θ, H''(I) = -Θ²e⁻ᴵ

<a id='e9fbd724-960c-4cb7-817f-79be38a3769c'></a>

(i) When R₀ > 1, H(0) = R₀ - 1 > 0. Meanwhile, H(∞) < 0. If Θ ≠ 0
H''(I) = -Θ²e⁻ᵀᴵ < 0,

<a id='dea5907c-1938-4f66-979e-91dbc159b72c'></a>

we have H'(I) < H'(0), namely, Θe⁻θI < Θ, then

H'(I) = - R₀/R₀₁ Θ + Θe^(-ΘI) < Θ(1 - R₀/R₀₁).

<a id='5f511563-5144-4f76-9932-f439735f4701'></a>

When R₀ > R₀₁, then H(I) = 0 has a unique positive solution.
If Θ = 0, according to Eq. (3.16), we have

I = \frac{A\rho}{(\alpha_1 + \rho)(\alpha_2 + \gamma + \alpha_1) - \gamma\rho} (1 - \frac{1}{\mathcal{R}_0}) (3.19)

<a id='689529b8-5ac0-4a20-8591-7451d12001e5'></a>

Similarly, when R₀ > 1, I > 0. Thus, the endemic equilibrium P₁* = (S₁*, E₁*, I₁*, M₁*) can be obtained.
(ii) When R₀ < 1, H(0) = R₀ - 1 < 0, and H(∞) < 0. We suppose that H'(I) = 0, then I = (1/ω) ln (R₀₁/R₀). When R₀ < R₀₁, I is positive. Further, I also is a positive solution H(I) = 0 if and only if R₀ = Rₚ. Thus, the endemic equilibrium P₂* = (S₂*, E₂*, I₂*, M₂*) can be obtained.
(iii) Based on (ii), when R₀ > Rₚ, H(I) > 0, then H(I) = 0 has two different positive solutions. Thus, the endemic equilibria Pᵢ* = (Sᵢ*, Eᵢ*, Iᵢ*, Mᵢ*)(i = 3, 4) can be obtained.

3.4. Stability of the endemic equilibria

**Theorem 3.4.1.** The endemic equilibria Pᵢ*(i = 1, 2, 3, 4) of the system (2.1) have:
(i) The endemic equilibrium P₁* is locally asymptotically stable, when R₀ > max (1, R₀₁), and a₁(I₁*)a₂(I₁*) – a₃(I₁*) > 0, a₁(I₁*)(a₂(I₁*)a₃(I₁*) – a₁(I₁*)a₄(I₁*)) – (a₁(I₃*))² > 0, a₄(I₁*) > 0;
(ii) The endemic equilibrium P₂* is a saddle node point, when Rₚ = R₀ < min (1, R₀₁);
(iii) The endemic equilibrium P₃* is an unstable saddle point, when Rₚ < R₀ < min (1, R₀₁);
(iv) The endemic equilibrium P₄* is an stable node point, when Rₚ < R₀ < min (1, R₀₁).

<a id='2cac75de-dfc2-45d9-96d3-164345b46c1c'></a>

Proof. The characteristic equation of system (2.1) at the endemic equilibria $P_i^*(i = 1, 2, 3, 4)$ is

$\begin{vmatrix}
\lambda + (\alpha_1 + \beta I_i^*e^{-aM_i^*}) & 0 & \beta S_i^*e^{-aM_i^*} - \gamma & -\alpha \beta I_i^*S_i^*e^{-aM_i^*} \\
-\beta I_i^*e^{-aM_i^*} & \lambda + (\alpha_1 + \rho) & -\beta S_i^*e^{-aM_i^*} & \alpha \beta I_i^*S_i^*e^{-aM_i^*} \\
0 & -\rho & \lambda + (\gamma + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2) & 0 \\
-\mu_1 & -\mu_2 & -\mu_3 & \lambda + \tau
\end{vmatrix} = 0. \quad (3.20)$

<a id='89563693-99b4-4a01-af82-9a94765002fd'></a>

We set Φ = βe^(-αMᵢ*), then the characteristic equation can be rewritten as:

It is clear that $a_1(I_1^*) > 0$, according to Routh–Hurwitz criteria [21], the proof (i) of Theorem 3.4.1 is obtained.

(ii) Due to the proof of (ii) of Theorem 3.3.1, we have $I_2^* = \frac{1}{\Theta} \ln \frac{\mathcal{R}_{01}}{\mathcal{R}_0}$ and $\Phi I_2^* = \alpha_1 \Theta I_2^*$. Therefore, by (3.22), we have,

$a_1(I_2^*) = 3\alpha_1 + \rho + \gamma + \alpha_2 + \tau + \Phi I_2^* > 0$,

by (3.25) and $I_2^* = \frac{1}{\Theta} \ln \frac{\mathcal{R}_{01}}{\mathcal{R}_0}$, we know that,

$a_4(I_2^*) = \tau\alpha_1(\alpha_1 + \rho)(\alpha_2 + \gamma + \alpha_1)((1 + \Theta I_2^*) - (1 + \Theta I_2^*)) = 0$

<a id='6e09dc5b-974c-4e11-abfb-82d457b01705'></a>

from (3.24), we obtain,

$a_3(I_2^*) = (2\alpha_1 + \rho + \gamma + \alpha_2)(\alpha_1\tau + \Phi I_2^*) + \Phi I_2^*(\alpha_1 + \rho)(\alpha_2 + \gamma + \alpha_1)$

$- \left(\frac{A\Theta}{R_{01}} + \gamma\right)I_2^*\alpha((\alpha_2 + \gamma + 2\alpha_1)(\mu_1 - \mu_2) + \rho(\mu_1 - \mu_3))$.

<a id='de690280-933f-4216-a5b9-b4636bce2cb5'></a>

It is easy to know that a₃(I₂*) < 0. Therefore we know that Eq. (3.30) has negative, positive and zero eigenvalues.

G(λ) = λ⁴ + a₁(I₂*)λ³ + a₂(I₂*)λ² + a₃(I₂*)λ + a₄(I₂*) = 0.                                                                        (3.30)

So the endemic equilibrium $P_2^*$ of the system (2.1) is a saddle node point.
(iii) By the proof of (iii) of Theorem 3.3.1, we have $I_3^* < I_2^* = \frac{1}{\Theta} \ln \frac{\mathcal{R}_{01}}{\mathcal{R}_0}$. Then $\Phi I_3^* < \alpha_1 \Theta I_2^*$. Therefore, by (3.22), we can get,

a₁(I₃*) = 3α₁ + ρ + γ + α₂ + τ + ΦI₃* > 0,

G(λ) = λ⁴ + a₁(I₄*)λ³ + a₂(I₄*)λ² + a₃(I₄*)λ + a₄(I₄*) = 0.                                                                        (3.32)

<a id='73b1266c-9107-489d-a0ab-b7d1b6aa0a36'></a>

We know that Eq. (3.32) has properties:

<a id='2e554484-9d78-4d6e-865f-2ba8f60cd0e6'></a>

\(\psi_1(I_4^*) + \psi_2(I_4^*) + \psi_3(I_4^*) + \psi_4(I_4^*) = -a_1(I_4^*) < 0,\) (3.33)

<a id='7c193e88-72eb-4b15-a287-3809a5acf85a'></a>

and

$\psi_1(I_4^*)\psi_2(I_4^*)\psi_3(I_4^*)\psi_4(I_4^*) = a_4(I_4^*) > 0.$
(3.34)

<a id='008fb28f-cc07-43af-a32a-585a24422885'></a>

Therefore, we can readily yield $\psi_j(I_4^*) < 0(j = 1, 2, 3, 4)$. If we may take the suppose $Re(\psi_1(I_4^*)) \leq Re(\psi_2(I_4^*)) < 0 < Re(\psi_3(I_4^*)) \leq Re(\psi_4(I_4^*))$, it leads to a contradiction with (3.33). Therefore the endemic equilibrium $P_4^*$ of the system (2.1) is a stable node point.
This completes the proof of Theorem 3.4.1. □

3.5.2. A Hopf bifurcation

<a id='1d14c20d-8a00-4602-8a24-bf0c90848563'></a>

Theorem 3.5.2. A Hopf bifurcation occurs around the endemic equilibrium P₁*, when β increases and the β** is crossed.

<a id='23ca3e61-404a-40e8-9639-48b948565ba1'></a>

**Proof.** We presume that characteristic equation (3.21) of system (2.1) around the endemic equilibrium P₁* has two real roots λ₁, λ₂, and a couple of complex roots a ± bi, where λ₁ < 0, λ₂ < 0 and a, b ∈ R. Therefore, we have,

<a id='33e0f237-68d3-4339-bb64-779d13e23f9f'></a>

G(λ) = (λ – λ₁) (λ – λ₂) (λ – (a + bi)) (λ – (a – bi))
= λ⁴ – (λ₁ + λ₂ + 2a)λ³ + (λ₁λ₂ + 2a(λ₁ + λ₂) + (a² + b²))λ²

<a id='b994b74d-5092-4229-a40a-1fb66a80ff25'></a>

- ((a² + b²)(λ₁ + λ₂) + 2aλ₁λ₂)λ + (a² + b²)λ₁λ₂.

<a id='fa67747f-5be9-40c9-9a55-33155856c532'></a>

Comparing with Eq. (3.21), we get,

<a id='aad02066-b159-4b2d-b4c2-e97048de1ea4'></a>

a₁(I₁*) = −(λ₁ + λ₂ + 2a), a₂(I₁*) = (λ₁λ₂ + 2a(λ₁ + λ₂) + (a² + b²)),
a₃(I₁*) = −((a² + b²)(λ₁ + λ₂) + 2aλ₁λ₂), a₄(I₁*) = (a² + b²)λ₁λ₂.

<a id='a80b96c4-6d75-43f9-a335-7bd5c61f1ed5'></a>

Therefore, we consider the case when the characteristic equation G(λ) = 0 has two real roots λ1, λ2 and a pair of purely imaginary roots ±bi; i.e., a = 0, where λ1 < 0, λ2 < 0 and b ∈ R. Thus, we yield,

<a id='e2ba98e0-b2e1-4505-bab0-511a13345749'></a>

a₁(I₁*) = -(λ₁ + λ₂), a₂(I₁*) = b² + λ₁λ₂, a₃(I₁*) = -b²(λ₁ + λ₂), a₄(I₁*) = b²λ₁λ₂.

<a id='5a8c4fb6-7b3d-4e14-bbeb-e84d99908c3a'></a>

Then,

$a_3(I_1^*)(a_1(I_1^*)a_2(I_1^*) - a_3)(I_1^*) - (a_1(I_1^*))^2 a_4(I_1^*) = 0,$

<a id='420b370e-8438-4aed-994f-d5aa3e3d272b'></a>

which leads to β = β**, as shown in the proof of Theorem 3.4.1. As a result, the occurrence of a pair of purely imaginary roots corresponds to the threshold curve β = β**.

<a id='e45529e2-d4a7-4e38-9292-fd978815493d'></a>

In order to see how the real parts of the others eigenvalues $a \pm bi$ change their signs, we examine the transversality condition of the Hopf bifurcation. Substituting $a + bi$ into the characteristic equation (3.21), we obtain $G(a + bi) = 0$. Accordingly, $Re(G(a + bi)) = 0$, where $Re$ means the real part of a complex number. Computing $Re(G(a+bi)) = 0$, we yield,

<a id='3eb40cd1-9e91-4dfc-931d-506c4ce563ff'></a>

Δ = Re((a + bi)⁴ + a₁(I₁*)(a + bi)³ + a₂(I₁*)(a + bi)² + a₃(I₁*)(a + bi) + a₄(I₁*))
= a⁴ - 6a²b² + b⁴ + a₁(I₁*)(a³ - 3ab²) + a₂(I₁*)(a² - b²) + a₃(I₁*)a + a₄(I₁*)
= 0.

<a id='0fe217a6-5423-43a4-92aa-f2d0b1094daa'></a>

From (3.26)-(3.29), we know that a₁(I₁*), a₂(I₁*), a₃(I₁*), and a₄(I₁*) depend upon β owing to Φ contains β. Thus, Δ is a function with regard to a and β. Consequently, Δ(a, β) = 0 defines an implicit function a(β) with the independent variable β.
Differentiating Δ with respect to β, we obtain ∂Δ/∂β = 0, which leads to (∂Δ/∂a)(∂a/∂β) + ∂Δ/∂β = 0. Hence, ∂a/∂β = - (∂Δ/∂β) / (∂Δ/∂a).
Next, we determine the sign of ∂a/∂β along the curve β = β**. Since a₁(I₁*), a₂(I₁*), a₃(I₁*) and a₄(I₁*) count on β, and that a = 0 and a₂(I₁*) = b² + λ₁λ₂ on the curve β = β**, we have,

<a id='6faf2312-fcfb-436e-bc12-63d4fce02060'></a>

$$\frac{\partial\Delta}{\partial\beta}\bigg|_{\beta=\beta^{**}} = \left(\left(a^3 - 3ab^2\right) \frac{\partial a_1(I_1^*)}{\partial\beta} + \left(a^2 - b^2\right) \frac{\partial a_2(I_1^*)}{\partial\beta} + a \frac{\partial a_3(I_1^*)}{\partial\beta} + \frac{\partial a_4(I_1^*)}{\partial\beta}\right)\bigg|_{\beta=\beta^{**}}$$

Since λ₁ < 0 and λ₂ < 0, then λ₁+λ₂ < 0, combining b² > 0, we have ∂Δ/∂a |β=β** < 0. In order to ensure the sign of ∂Δ/∂β |β=β** according to (3.11), we yield,

λ₃,₄ = \frac{-(γ + ρ + α₂ + 2α₁) ± \sqrt{(γ + ρ + α₂ + 2α₁)² - 4(α₁ + ρ)(α₂ + γ + α₁)(1 - R₀)}}{2}

<a id='e0b3ccd1-49e2-4f34-b337-144a77af9ac8'></a>

We change the form of above equality so as to obtain b, namely,
λ3,4 = -(γ + ρ + α2 + 2α1) ± √4(α1 + ρ)(α2 + γ + α1)(1 - R0) - (γ + p + α2 + 2α1)²i / 2

<a id='cd37cb27-7bbc-41ab-9a2f-19fb302dece9'></a>

Consequently, we obtain,
b = \sqrt{(\alpha_1 + \rho)(\alpha_2 + \gamma + \alpha_1)(1 - \mathcal{R}_0) - \frac{(\alpha_2 + \gamma + \rho + 2\alpha_1)^2}{4}}

<a id='91cc8be6-1aed-4221-a4d3-dd783bf99a70'></a>

Substituting the expression of b into the expression of $\frac{\partial \Delta}{\partial \beta}\Big|_{\beta=\beta^{**}}$, we get,

$\frac{\partial \Delta}{\partial \beta}\Big|_{\beta=\beta^{**}} = (-b^2(\alpha_2 + \gamma + 2\alpha_1 + \rho + \tau) + \tau(\alpha_1 + \rho)(\alpha_2 + \gamma + \alpha_1))I_1^*e^{-\alpha M_1^*}$

Since R₀ > 1, thus, ∂Δ/∂β|β=β** > 0. In a word, we have,

## 4. Numerical simulation

In this section, we present some numerical results of system (2.1) that support and extend our theoretical results. We choose some parameters based on the Table 1.
We choose a set of the following parameters:

A = 0.8 day⁻¹, α₁ = 0.6 day⁻¹, β = 0.8 person⁻¹ day⁻¹, α = 0.08 message⁻¹, μ₁ = 0.99 day⁻¹,
μ₂ = 0.4 day⁻¹, μ₃ = 0.8 day⁻¹, τ = 0.6 day⁻¹, α₂ = 0.02 day⁻¹, γ = 0.7 day⁻¹, ρ = 0.09 day⁻¹.

It is easy to verify that $R_0$ = 0.0884 < 1. Further, we have the unique disease-free equilibrium $P_0$ = (1.3333, 0, 0, 2.2) of system (2.1). Then, from Theorem 3.2.1, the disease-free equilibrium $P_0$ = (1.3333, 0, 0, 2.2) of system (2.1) is globally asymptotically stable when $R_0$ = 0.0884 < 1 (Fig. 2).
Next, we select a set of the following parameters:

It is ready to verify that R₀ = 2.4882 > 1. Then, from Theorem 3.4.1, the endemic equilibrium P₁* of system (2.1) is locally asymptotically stable when R₀ > max(1, R₀₁), where R₀₁ = 1.6833 (Fig. 3).
Since

<a id='11909a80-7c6d-47a5-a84b-30e0b00d8755'></a>

R_0 = \frac{\beta \rho A e^{-\frac{\alpha \mu_1 A}{\alpha_1 \tau}}}{\alpha_1 (\alpha_1 + \rho)(\gamma + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2)}.

<a id='d4471b2a-72b6-46a5-9060-edc27e4aa524'></a>

So we can see $\mathcal{R}_0$ is an aggregate of parameters in the model. According to [23], a bifurcation parameter $\beta$ in $\mathcal{R}_0$ is allowed to vary, and hence $\mathcal{R}_0$ itself varies. Thus we choose a set of parameters in $\mathcal{R}_0$:

<a id='3efa7ab6-39e0-46fc-ae5f-19bf0177647e'></a>

A = 0.8day⁻¹, α₁ = 0.6day⁻¹, α = 0.08message⁻¹, μ₁ = 0.99day⁻¹, τ = 0.6day⁻¹,
α₂ = 0.02day⁻¹, γ = 0.7day⁻¹, ρ = 0.09day⁻¹, β ∈ (0.035, 0.275]person⁻¹day⁻¹,

Therefore, R0 ∈ {0.90, 1.25).
Fig. 4 suggests a forward bifurcation happens when R0 crosses unity from below for system (2.1). A small positive asymptotically stable equilibrium appears and the disease-free equilibrium losses its stability. The x - axis shows R0, the average number of new infectious produced by an infectious individual near the disease-free equilibrium. In system (2.1),

The plot shows two main curves: a red horizontal line along the x-axis from R₀ = 0.90 to R₀ = 1.00, and a blue curve that starts at (R₀=1.00, Number infected=0.00) and increases non-linearly as R₀ increases, reaching approximately (R₀=1.25, Number infected=0.18). Annotations on the plot indicate stability regions: an arrow points to the red line segment for R₀ < 1, labeled "DFE is stable"; an arrow points to the blue curve for R₀ > 1, labeled "EE is stable"; and another arrow points to the x-axis for R₀ > 1, labeled "DFE is unstable". The caption further explains: "The curve shows the non-trivial bifurcating equilibrium. The arrows show the direction of flow for the model disease system, after the system reaches the manifold on which slow dynamics occur; When R₀ < 1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable; When R₀ > 1, the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and there is a stable endemic equilibrium." ::>

if everyone is susceptible at the disease-free equilibrium, R_0 would be βe^(-αM) / ρ. For a given set of parameters, R_0 remains fixed, and the change in the number of infectives is shown by the diagram. When R_0 < 1, the number of infectives reduces to zero, while when R_0 > 1, the number of infectives will increase or decrease to the curved line that marks the endemic equilibrium. At the same time, the absence of positive equilibrium near the disease-free when R_0 < 1, in other words, the disease-free equilibrium is often the only equilibrium for R_0 < 1, and a low level of endemicity when R_0 is slightly above 1. Fig. 5 implies a backward bifurcation happens when R_0 is less than unity. A small positive unstable equilibrium appears while the disease-free equilibrium and a larger positive equilibrium are locally asymptotically stable. Epidemiologically, a backward bifurcation shows that it is not enough to only reduce the basic reproductive number to less than one to eliminate a disease and that when R_0 crosses unity, hysteresis takes place.

Then, we elect a set of the following parameters:

$A = 0.8day^{-1}$, $\alpha_1 = 0.009day^{-1}$, $\beta = 0.0099person^{-1}day^{-1}$, $\alpha = 0.00091message^{-1}$, $\mu_2 = 0.8day^{-1}$, $\mu_1 = 0.008day^{-1}$, $\mu_3 = 0.8day^{-1}$, $\tau = 0.03day^{-1}$, $\alpha_2 = 0.5day^{-1}$, $\gamma = 0.08day^{-1}$, $\rho = 0.99day^{-1}$.

Finally, we choose a set of the following parameters:

## 5. Sensitivity analysis

In this section, we perform sensitivity analyses of the basic reproductive number R₀ and the infectious individuals I. First, we perform the sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number R₀. We study the influence of α, μ₁ and β to R₀. It is straightforward from (3.4) that R₀ increases as β increases. This agrees with the intuition that higher transmission coefficient increases the basic reproduction number. In order to see the relationship of these parameters and R₀, we regard R₀ as a function about those parameters. Note that

∂R₀ / ∂α = - (βρAμ₁) / (μ²τ(α₁ + ρ)(γ + α₁ + α₂)) e^(αμ₁A / α₁τ) < 0,

∂R₀ / ∂μ₁ = - (βρAα) / (α₁²τ(α₁ + ρ)(γ + α₁ + α₂)) e^(αμ₁A / α₁τ) < 0.

<a id='0cef17cb-4c65-4a62-8e18-6c184341ef14'></a>

Therefore, we find that R₀ decreases as α and μ₁ increase. The parameter values are
A = 0.8day⁻¹, α = 0.8day⁻¹, τ = 0.6day⁻¹, β = 0.8person⁻¹day⁻¹, ρ = 0.4day⁻¹,
μ₁ = 0.2day⁻¹, μ₂ = 0.8day⁻¹, μ₃ = 0.8day⁻¹, α₁ = 0.2day⁻¹, α₂ = 0.02day⁻¹, γ = 0.6day⁻¹.
Fig. 8(a) shows that the basic reproduction R₀ is reducing when α is increasing. Fig. 8(b) suggests that the basic reproduction R₀ is reducing when μ₁ is increasing.
Second, we main consider the effect of α, μ₁, τ, γ on the dynamics of infected individuals. The parameters are
A = 0.8day⁻¹, α = 0.8day⁻¹, τ = 0.6day⁻¹, β = 0.8person⁻¹day⁻¹, ρ = 0.4day⁻¹,
μ₁ = 0.2day⁻¹, μ₂ = 0.8day⁻¹, μ₃ = 0.8day⁻¹, α₁ = 0.2day⁻¹, α₂ = 0.02day⁻¹, γ = 0.6day⁻¹.
From Fig. 9, we know that infected number will decrease when α, μ₁ and γ increase, and increase when τ increases.
From Figs. 8 and 9, we find that media coverage has a great impact on the transmission of epidemic diseases.

6. Discussion

A new SEIS epidemic disease with the impact of media is formulated and stability of the steady states is proved. When R0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable; When R0 > 1, the disease-free equilibrium is unstable. Meanwhile, When R0 = 1, a forward and backward bifurcation occur, which show a more and more complicated dynamics behavior of disease transmission. A Hopf bifurcation occurs when a threshold curve is crossed, which implies the possibility of multiple outbreaks of epidemic disease. Our results show that the media coverage are helpful in reducing the spread of epidemic disease.

If we consider a multi-group model. The system (2.1) can be rewritten:

$\dot{S}_i = A_i + \gamma I_i - S_i \sum_{j=1}^{n} \beta_{ij} e^{-\alpha_{ij} M_{ij}} I_j - \mu_i S_i,$

$\dot{E}_i = S_i \sum_{j=1}^{n} \beta_{ij} e^{-\alpha_{ij} M_{ij}} I_j - \rho_i E_i - \mu_i E_i,$

$\dot{I}_i = \rho_i E_i - \gamma I_i - (\mu_i + d_i) I_i,$

$\dot{T}_i = \mu_{1i} S + \mu_{2i} E + \mu_{3i} I_i - \tau_i M_i.$ (6.1)

Here Sᵢ, Eᵢ, Iᵢ and Mᵢ are the number of susceptible individuals, exposed individuals, infective individuals, messages, respectively, in group i. The other parameters have the same as meaning of the system (2.1). We leave these works for the future.
