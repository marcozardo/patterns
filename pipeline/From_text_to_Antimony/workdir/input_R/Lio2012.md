## Abstract

**Background:** This work focuses on the computational modelling of osteomyelitis, a bone pathology caused by bacteria infection (mostly *Staphylococcus aureus*). The infection alters the RANK/RANKL/OPG signalling dynamics that regulates osteoblasts and osteoclasts behaviour in bone remodelling, i.e. the resorption and mineralization activity. The infection rapidly leads to severe bone loss, necrosis of the affected portion, and it may even spread to other parts of the body. On the other hand, osteoporosis is not a bacterial infection but similarly is a defective bone pathology arising due to imbalances in the RANK/RANKL/OPG molecular pathway, and due to the progressive weakening of bone structure.

Results: Since both osteoporosis and osteomyelitis cause loss of bone mass, we focused on comparing the dynamics of these diseases by means of computational models. Firstly, we performed meta-analysis on a gene expression data of normal, osteoporotic and osteomyelitis bone conditions. We mainly focused on RANKL/OPG signalling, the TNF and TNF receptor superfamilies and the NF-kB pathway. Using information from the gene expression data we estimated parameters for a novel model of osteoporosis and of osteomyelitis. Our models could be seen as a hybrid ODE and probabilistic verification modelling framework which aims at investigating the dynamics of the effects of the infection in bone remodelling. Finally we discuss different diagnostic estimators defined by formal verification techniques, in order to assess different bone pathologies (osteopenia, osteoporosis and osteomyelitis) in an effective way.

Conclusions: We present a modeling framework able to reproduce aspects of the different bone remodeling defective dynamics of osteomyelitis and osteoporosis. We report that the verification-based estimators are meaningful in the light of a feed forward between computational medicine and clinical bioinformatics.

## Background
There are two main types of bone tissues: *cortical bone*,
and *trabecular bone*. The former is a compact tissue that
makes up the outer shell of bones. It consists of a very
hard (virtually solid) mass of bony tissue arranged in con-
centric layers called Haversian systems. Trabecular (also
known as cancellous or "spongy") tissue is located
beneath the compact bone and consists of a meshwork of
bony bars (trabeculae) with many interconnecting spaces
containing bone marrow. Both bone tissues undergo a
continuous remodelling dynamics where old bone is
replaced by new tissue ensuring the mechanical integrity

_Bone remodelling (BR)_ is a cellular process conducted by _osteoclasts_, the cells responsible for bone resorption and by _osteoblasts_, the cells responsible for bone formation. Osteoblasts follow osteoclasts in a highly coordinated manner, forming the so-called _Basic Multi-cellular Units (BMUs)_. While osteoblasts and osteoclasts are located in the fluid part of the BMU, another type of cells, the _osteocytes_, are trapped in the bone matrix and they play a relevant role in the remodelling process. Osteocytes serve as mechanosensors: they translate mechanical stimuli at the tissue level into biochemical

work to the BMU cells. In normal bone, the number of
BMUs, the bone resorption rate, and the bone formation
rate are all relatively constant [3].

The _RANK/RANKL/OPG_ signalling pathway plays an important role in bone metabolism. RANK is a protein expressed by osteoclasts; RANK is a receptor for RANKL, a protein produced by osteoblasts. RANK/RANKL signalling triggers osteoclast differentiation, proliferation and activation, thus it prominently affects the resorption phase during bone remodelling. Osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a decoy receptor for RANKL. It is expressed by mature osteoblasts and it binds to RANKL, thus inhibiting the production of osteoclasts. Figure 1 shows the key steps during the bone remodelling process, that are:

1. **Origination.** During normal turnover or after a micro-crack, or as a response to mechanical stress, the osteocytes in the bone matrix produce biochemical signals showing sufferance towards the lining cells, i.e. the surface cells around the bone. The

<a id='1f436f76-63b6-4031-be16-2a9a612ce43e'></a>

lining cells pull away from the bone matrix, forming a canopy which merges with the blood vessels.
2. **Osteoclast recruitment.** Stromal cells divide and differentiate into osteoblasts precursors. Pre-osteoblasts start to express RANKL, inducing the differentiation of and attracting pre-osteoclasts, which have RANK receptors on their surfaces. RANKL is a homotrimeric molecule displayed on the membrane of osteoblasts that stimulates differentiation in osteoclasts and is a key induction molecule involved in bone resorption leading to bone destruction.
3. **Resorption.** The pre-osteoclasts enlarge and fuse into mature osteoclasts. In cortical BMUs, osteoclasts excavate cylindrical tunnels in the predominant loading direction of the bone, while in trabecular bone they act at the bone surface, digging a trench rather than a tunnel. After the resorption process has terminated, osteoclasts undergo apoptosis.

4. **Osteoblast recruitment.** Pre-osteoblasts mature
into osteoblasts and start producing osteoprotegerin
(OPG). OPG inhibits the osteoclastic activity by

The bone surface is represented by a beige layer, with a darker layer below representing the bone matrix.  The legend defines the cell types: Osteocyte (blue star-like shape), Pre-osteoblast (pink oval), Pre-osteoclast (yellow irregular shape), Osteoblast (pink oval with a flat side), and Osteoclast (yellow irregular shape with a ruffled border).  The stages are:  1 - Origination: Osteocytes (blue stars) embedded in the bone matrix send green conical signals downwards to the fluid part. Pre-osteoblasts (pink ovals) and pre-osteoclasts (yellow irregular shapes) are present below the bone surface, with some pre-osteoblasts appearing to receive signals.  2 - Osteoclast recruitment: Osteocytes are present. Pre-osteoblasts and pre-osteoclasts are shown. An inset shows a pre-osteoblast (pink) with RANKL and a pre-osteoclast (yellow) with a RANK receptor on its surface, indicating RANKL/RANK binding. Several pre-osteoclasts are shown moving towards the bone surface, some beginning to fuse.  3 - Resorption: Mature osteoclasts (yellow irregular shapes with ruffled borders) are actively attached to and resorbing the bone surface, which appears eroded. Osteocytes are embedded in the bone.  4 - Osteoblast recruitment: The bone surface is now resorbed and irregular. Pre-osteoblasts (pink ovals) are recruited to the resorbed surface. An inset shows an osteoblast (pink oval with flat side) with OPG and RANKL. Mature osteoblasts begin to form a layer on the bone surface.  5 - Mineralization: A layer of osteoblasts (pink ovals with flat side) covers the newly formed bone matrix (osteoid), which is shown calcifying with small blue crystalline structures. Osteocytes are embedded within the new matrix.  6 - Resting: The bone surface is smooth and restored to its original state, with osteocytes embedded in the matrix.  Figure 1 Key steps in bone remodelling. 1) Osteocytes send signals to the fluid part, activating pre-osteoblasts (Pb) and pre-osteoclasts (Pc). 2) Pbs express RANKL and Pcs express the RANK receptor. 3) RANK/RANKL binding induces Pcs' proliferation. Pcs enlarge and fuse, forming mature osteoclasts which start the bone resorption process. 4) Mature osteoblasts express the decoy receptor OPG and start the bone formation process. RANKL/OPG binding inhibits RANKL, thus protecting bone from excessive resorption. 5) During the mineralization process, osteoids secreted by osteoblasts calcify. 6) Finally in the resting phase, the initial situation is re-established.::>

5. **Mineralization.** Osteoblasts fill the cavity by secreting layers of osteoids. Once the complete mineralization of the renewed tissue is reached, some osteoblasts can go apoptosis, other can turn into lining cells, while other can remain trapped in the bone matrix and become osteocytes.

The bone remodelling undergoes a pathological process, generally related to ageing, termed osteopenia and with more severity, osteoporosis, during which an unbalance of the RANKL/OPG signalling equilibrium is typically observed. The osteoporosis is a skeletal disease characterized by low *Bone Mineral Density (BMD)* and structural fragility, which consequently leads to frequent micro-damages and spontaneous fractures; it is a chronic disease requiring long-term treatment. This disease primarily affects middle-aged women and elderly people and at present its social and economic impact is dramatically increasing, so much that the World Health Organization considers it to be the second-leading healthcare problem. While under normal circumstances, the ratio of RANKL/OPG is carefully balanced, the increase of RANKL plays an essential role in favouring resorption through osteoclast formation, function, and survival. With ageing and after a large number of remodelling cycles, the density of osteons increases and the cortical porosity and architectural defects of the bone increase as well. This leads to a vicious cycle where microdamages and consequently remodelling occur more and more frequently, weakening the bone structure and increasing the rate of spontaneous fractures [4]. Moreover, recent studies suggest that plasma levels OPG and RANKL are inversely related to bone mineral density and contribute to the development of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women [5], and thalassemia-induced osteoporosis [6]. One of the most worrying events is the infection of the bone which causes a disease called osteomyelitis. Similarly to osteoporosis, it is characterized by severe and rapid bone loss and by an unbalance at the molecular signalling level.

The aim of this work is to provide a computational
modelling framework able to reproduce and compare
the defective dynamics of osteoporosis and osteomyeli-
tis. We believe that this framework could easily be
adapted to model also other bone diseases like multiple
myelomas or Paget's disease, and that it could help in
better understanding the disruptions of cellular and
signalling mechanisms that underlie such bone
pathologies.

# Osteomyelitis

Osteomyelitis is a bone infection mainly caused by the aggressive pathogen S. aureus. Upon exposure to the bone, S. aureus induces a severe inflammatory response followed by progressive bone destruction and loss of the vasculature and with a persistent chronic infection; this is further complicated by the rapid emergence of resistant strains of S. aureus. Lab researches have shown that the infection prevents proliferation, induces apoptosis and inhibits mineralisation of cultured osteoblasts. The action of S. aureus increases RANKL expression and decreases OPG expression in osteoblasts in patients with staphylococcal osteomyelitis. Recent findings suggest that S. aureus SpA protein binds to osteoblasts, possibly through an interaction with the death receptor TNFR-1 which induces caspase 3 activation and apoptosis. The increase in RANKL is likely to trigger osteoclast-induced bone resorption and bone destruction and may help explain why patients with osteomyelitis have significant bone loss [7].

Although effective treatment of this disease is very difficult, one of most used drug is the fusidic acid that acts as a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor by preventing the turnover of elongation factor G (EF-G) from the ribosome. Fusidic acid inhibits bacterial replication and does not kill the bacteria, and is therefore termed "bacteriostatic". Many strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) remain sensitive to fusidic acid, but because there is a low genetic barrier to drug resistance (a single point mutation is all that is required), fusidic acid is usually combined with other antibiotics.

We believe that a model of the infection could provide
a framework for a better diagnosis and understanding
the antibiotic intervention. Here we develop a hybrid
modelling framework for combining and untangling the
relationships of physiological and molecular data. We
then apply the methodology to determine disease related
abnormalities of the key osteogenesis molecular net-
work. The universality of the approach is demonstrated
by an integration of the modelling and diagnosis which
resembles medical visits with blood testing for infection
progress and bone mineralisation measurements along a
period of time. Our perspective is that this approach
would inch towards an automatized methodology for
improving disease classification and diagnosis.

## Results and discussion
### Meta analysis of gene expression data
Important parameter values of bone remodelling models are based on various authors (see [8] among others); here we also analysed more recent data, particularly available gene expression data. Since that both osteoporosis and osteomyelitis cause loss of bone mass, we decided to cross-compare gene expression datasets of both diseases.

We have compared the expression levels of genes involved in osteomyelitis, osteoporosis patients and healthy controls using the box plots and comparison table (Figure 2, 3 and Table 1). We report in Table 1 the significant genes associated with the infection of osteomyelitis and or with the condition of osteoporosis. From the analysis of our data, we observe that few genes, related to TNF, TNF receptor superfamilies and to NF-kB have statistically different levels of expression in healthy controls, osteomyelitis and or osteoporosis. We observe that, with respect to control cases, for the microarray platform GPL96, 22 genes related to RANKL, RANK, OPG, NF-kB proteins, TNF and TNF receptor superfamilies are over expressed and 13 genes are down regulated in osteomyelitis (see Figure 2 and Table 1). There are other 47 genes that are weakly correlated with this infection (not shown). However, in case of GPL97 microarray platform, only 10 genes are highly expressed; 6 genes are down expressed (other 15 genes are weakly correlated in osteomyelitis) (see Figure 3 and Table 1). For the osteoporosis condition, using the platform GPL96, only 10 genes are up regulated and 6 are down regulated (see Table 1). It is notable in the platform GPL96, only 4 genes NFKB2_1, NFKB2_2, REL_2 and RELB are up-regulated in both types of diseases. In contrast, only 3 genes TNFRSF25_2, TRAF3IP3_1 and TRAF5 are down regulated in the both osteomyelitis infection and osteoporosis. However, 5 genes NFKB1, RELA_1, TNFRSF10B_2, TNFSF10_3 and TRAF3IP3_3 are differently regulated in osteomyelitis and osteoporosis.

Interestingly we found that, despite a very small
increase of RANKL gene expression in osteoporosis and
a larger increase in osteomyelitis, OPG gene expression

<a id='f3689af9-29d1-4d29-99c9-a6029ac1c78a'></a>

become more deregulated in both osteomyelitis and osteoporosis. There is the increased expression of different isoforms of OPG which are known to have different binding capability with RANKL and seem to be linked, from mice experiments, to hypocalcemia [9]. Therefore we report that gene expression in osteoporosis and osteomyelitis could generate an unbalance between RANKL and OPG due to the different OPG isoforms, but also other genes, related to TNF, TNF receptor superfamilies and to NF-kB may be involved. Although gene expression and actual protein abundance are only loosely correlated, taking into account the results of gene expression data, we modified the autocrine and paracrine parameters of the existing mathematical model based on Komarova model [10]. We considered more appropriate to incorporate into the model the algebraic relationship of positive and negative regulators (such as RANKL and OPG) than just the RANKL change. On the basis of this consideration we developed new models for reproducing osteoporotic and osteomyelitis conditions.

pathologies at a multicellular level. The model describes the continuous changes of, and the interactions between populations of osteoclasts and osteoblast (including bacteria in the osteomyelitis model). Bone density is calculated as the difference between the formation activity which is proportional to osteoblasts concentration, and the resorption activity which is proportional to osteoclasts concentration. In the last twenty years, a variety of mathematical and computational models has been proposed in order to better understand the dynamics of bone remodelling (reviewed in [13-15]). Three main categories of models can be distinguished: those focusing on the organ level, where bone is described as a continuum material only characterized by its density; on the biomechanical properties and on the microstructural information at the tissue level; and on the cellular level where the interactions occurring among the different types of bone cells are concerned. The latter category can also incorporate intracellular signalling pathways and mechanosensing mechanisms (i.e. the process by which mechanical stimuli are translated into cellular signals). Our cellular-level model is based on the work by Komarova et al [10], where they developed an important model for BR based on experimental results described in Parfitt's work [8] which has inspired many other similar models. In particular we extended it in order to explicitly simulate bone pathologies: osteoporosis is reproduced by including an ageing factor that decreases the death rates of cells and by including a factor that increases the RANKL expression; osteomyelitis is modelled by adding a state variable for bacteria that affects the autocrine and paracrine regulation factors of

<a id='255fa69a-5500-4d0e-9ef5-db1915102bf8'></a>

osteoblasts and osteoclasts, similarly to Ayati's model on
bone myeloma [16]. Although several efforts have been
made in developing mathematical model for osteomyeli-
tis and osteoporosis, molecular data has been rarely con-
sidered so far, regardless the availability of different gene
expression microarray data related to osteomyelitis and
osteoporosis and based on only single microarray data-
base. So, we have developed mathematical model and
showed the comparative study of gene expression data
from different databases of similar platform to find out
the genes expression level related to the RANKL,
RANK, OPG and NF-kB proteins, which are strongly
related to the osteomyelitis and osteoporosis.

**Model verification**
We define a stochastic model for bone remodelling from the ODE specification, that allows us to analyse the random fluctuations and the discrete changes of bone density and bone cells. Given that randomness is an inherent feature of biological systems, whose components are naturally discrete, the stochastic approach could give useful insights on the bone remodelling process. Indeed, stochasticity plays a key role in bone remodelling, e.g. the fluctuations in molecular concentrations of RANKL and OPG produce changes in the chemotaxis (the process by which cells move toward attractant molecules) of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. This may affect for example the cell differentiation, number and arrival time, and consequently the whole remodelling process. Besides achieving a good fitting between the ODE model and the stochastic one, we employ *probabilistic model checking techniques* for deriving three different clinical estimators that enable to assess the expected bone density, the density change

rate, and the variance of bone density. Model checking is
a static technique for automatically search for a property
(specified as a logical formula) to hold or not over a defi-
nite set of states, and relies on qualitative properties:
given a model and a property to verify, it returns an affir-
mative or a negative answer, i.e. the property holds or
not. Differently, probabilistic model checking is equipped
with quantitative information, and given a stochastic
model and a property to verify, it returns the probability
of the formula being satisfied. We believe that this kind
of quantitative, formal and automated analysis may
represent a step ahead in the understanding of bone dis-
eases like osteomyelitis and osteoporosis, by shifting the
attention from an informative, but empirical, analysis of

<a id='1c6c6fb7-6152-49de-829f-a84d3e0f71ed'></a>

the graphs produced by simulations towards more pre-
cise quantitative interpretations.

**Modelling bone remodelling pathologies**
The ODE model for bone remodelling is mainly inspired from the work by Komarova et al [10], and describes the dynamics of osteoblasts' (_Ob_) and osteoclasts' (_Oc_) population in a BMU, and calculates the bone density as a function of _Ob_ and _Oc_ with the following equations:

<a id='02768405-be90-46c2-ae52-26ebbcf5add4'></a>

$$\frac{dO_c}{dt} = \alpha_1 O_c^{g_{11}} O_b^{g_{21}} - \beta_1 O_c,$$ $$\frac{dO_b}{dt} = \alpha_2 O_c^{g_{12}} O_b^{g_{22}} - \beta_2 O_b.$$

The model describes the autocrine and paracrine rela-
tionships between osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Autocrine
signalling usually occurs by a secreted chemical interact-
ing with receptors on the surface of the same cell. In
the paracrine process a chemical signals that diffuse out-
side the emitting cell and interacts with receptors on
nearby cells. Here the parameters $g_{ij}$ describe the effec-
tiveness of autocrine and paracrine regulation, s.t. $g_{11}$
describes the osteoclast autocrine regulation, $g_{22}$ the
osteoblast autocrine regulation, $g_{21}$ is the osteoblast-
derived paracrine regulation, and $g_{12}$ is the osteoclast
paracrine regulation. The nonlinearities of these equa-
tions are approximations for the interactions of the
osteoclast and osteoblast populations in the proliferation
terms of the equations. The autocrine signalling has a
positive feedback on osteoclast production ($g_{11} >0$), and
paracrine signalling has a negative feedback on osteo-
clast production ($g_{21} <0$). The autocrine signalling has a
positive feedback on osteoblast production ($g_{22} >0$), and
paracrine signalling has a positive feedback on osteoblast
production ($g_{12} >0$).

Overall the regulatory circuit should lead to a positive mineralisation balance (z) which could be described by the expression dz/dt = -k1Oc + k2Ob where k1 and k2 are the resorption and formation rates, respectively. More precisely, the bone density is determined by the difference between the actual resorption and formation activity when osteoclasts and osteoblasts exceed their steady levels. Therefore bone density is calculated as follows:

<a id='74ff3c54-17ff-4453-bdb3-1f5931adff64'></a>

dz/dt = -k₁max(Oc – Ōc, 0) + k₂max(Ob – Ōb, 0),

<a id='1541a7ce-a256-45f7-954d-88d5fc98ecd8'></a>

where $\overline{O}_c$ and $\overline{O}_b$ denote the steady states of $O_c$ and $O_b$, resp. For the spongy type bone we consider the variable z as the localized trabecular mass beneath a point on the bone surface.

In order to reproduce the defective dynamics (i.e. bone negative balance) characterizing osteoporosis, we assumed an increased death rate for osteoclasts and osteoblasts, motivated by the fact that the occurrence of defective bone pathologies in elderly patients is partly attributable to the reduced cellular activity typical of those patients. Therefore we introduced the parameter gageing as a factor multiplying the death rates βi.

On the other hand, we modified the regulation factors in order to model an increased RANKL expression by osteoblasts, which results both from the analysis per-formed on gene expression data and from experimental evidences [6]. In our model g21 is the result of all the factors produced by osteoblasts that activates osteoclasts and as explained in [10], g21 = RANKL OPG where RANKL is the effectiveness of RANKL signalling while OPG is the effectiveness of OPG signalling. Therefore a

<a id='cf62d1f7-6b11-42d3-baff-f6a6e02d636b'></a>

further parameter gpor has been included as a factor
incrementing g21, in order to incorporate the changes in
the system RANKL, OPG associated to osteoporosis.
The resulting equations for osteoclasts and osteoblasts
are:

<a id='9fbc9726-9614-48dc-a282-7f454ac3d012'></a>

$$\frac{dO_c}{dt} = \alpha_1 O_c^{g_{11}} O_b^{g_{21}+g_{por}} - g_{ageing} \beta_1 O_c$$

$$\frac{dO_b}{dt} = \alpha_2 O_c^{g_{12}} O_b^{g_{22}} - g_{ageing} \beta_2 O_b$$

**Osteomyelitis effects on bone remodelling** Starting from the above model of bone remodelling, we consider the progressing of osteomyelitis induced by the *S. aureus* (variable *B*). Since several evidences show that the dynamics of the bacterial population follows a Gom-pertz curve, we consider an equation of the form

<a id='9b47df3a-9f5b-4e82-afb8-4194ee0aca2f'></a>

$$\frac{dB}{dt} = \gamma_B B \cdot \log\left(\frac{s}{B}\right),$$

<a id='9a579425-161c-4fd7-b0c5-923a93b14b1d'></a>

where $\gamma_B$ is the growth rate of bacteria, and $s$ is the carrying capacity, i.e. the maximum population size. Additionally, we introduced four parameters $f_{ij}$ used to model the effects of the infection on the autocrine and paracrine regulation factors $g_{ij}$. The resulting equations are:

<a id='86d08acc-6a3a-4cb6-8095-58559a7c5923'></a>

$$\frac{dO_c}{dt} = \alpha_1 O_c^{g_{11}(1+f_{11}\frac{B}{s})} O_b^{g_{21}(1+f_{21}\frac{B}{s})} - \beta_1 O_c$$

$$\frac{dO_b}{dt} = \alpha_2 O_c^{g_{12}(1+f_{12}\frac{B}{s})} O_b^{g_{22}-f_{22}\frac{B}{s}} - \beta_2 O_b$$

$$\frac{dB}{dt} = (\gamma_B - V)B \cdot \log\left(\frac{s}{B}\right).$$

This model has been inspired from Ayati's work on multiple myeloma bone disease [16] and the key differ-ence with respect to Komarova's model [10] is the addi-tion of the terms _f_ij_B/s that couple the bacterial density and its maximum size to the power laws for the osteo-clast/osteoblast interactions. The bacterial parameters _f_11, _f_12, _f_21, _f_22 are all nonnegative. The _S. aureus_-induced infection affects the normal remodelling activity by:

<a id='0d71a2b5-65cf-4572-a578-17f2c7990539'></a>

* reducing osteoblasts' growth rate: in fact, the paracrine promotion of osteoblasts is reduced (g₁₂/(1 + f₁₂ˢᴮ) < g₁₂, since g₁₂ > 0), and the autocrine promotion of osteoblasts is reduced as well (g₂₂ - f₂₂ˢᴮ < g₂₂);
* increasing RANKL and decreasing OPG expression: as previously stated, the paracrine inhibition of osteoclasts is a negative exponent resulting from the difference between the effectiveness of OPG signalling and that of RANKL signalling. Since g₂₁(1 - f₂₁ˢᴮ) > g₂₁,

the infection causes an increase in RANKL expression
and therefore a decrease in OPG expression.

In addition the infection increases the autocrine pro-motion of osteoclasts (since $g_{11} >0$). We have taken $\gamma_B$ to be independent of bone loss. The parameter $V$ describes the effectiveness of the antibiotic treatment as a factor decreasing the growth rate $\gamma_B$ of bacteria. Two different kinds of treatment can be distinguished: bacteriostatic treatments that stop bacteria proliferation ($V = \gamma_B$); and bacteriocide treatments which kill bacteria ($V > \gamma_B$).

Parameters for the three different models (control,
osteoporosis and osteomyelitis) are given in Table 2.
Simulation results for bone density, osteoblasts and
osteoblasts under the three different scenarios are com-
pared in Figure 4. The plots show that both osteoporosis
and osteomyelitis are characterized by a negative remo-
delling balance, but in the latter case the bone loss
becomes much more critical after 600 days. In the
osteoporotic case, the remodelling period is shorter than
in the control case, mimicking the fact that in older
patients microfractures and consequently remodelling
occur more frequently, in a vicious cycle that progres-
sively weakens the structure and density of the bone [4].
On the other hand, the regular cycles of the normal
bone model above are perturbed by the presence of the
infection (chronic), and we observe longer and unstable
remodelling periods.

<a id='ab75dca0-4c2b-461b-afb9-3b89bcca2bc7'></a>

Furthermore we simulate the dosage of a bacterio-
static treatment ($V = 0.005 = \gamma_B$) and of a bacteriocide
treatment ($V = 0.007 > \gamma_B$) for _S. Aureus_ at different

<a id='1788dd4a-2cb5-4e33-8894-6c4196a0196a'></a>

dosage times $t_{treat}$ = 200, 400 and 600 days. Figure 5 shows that when applying the bacteriostatic drug (e.g. fusidic acid), the severe bone loss characterizing osteo- myelitis can be limited only if the treatment is adminis- tered at $t$ = 200 days. With later dosages the normal remodelling activity cannot be re-established, even if the situation is considerably better w.r.t. an untreated infection. Conversely, the bacteriocide treatment looks more effective than the bacteriostatic one, and the bone activity is able to recover regardless the dosage time. However the recovery time becomes longer as $t_{treat}$ increases. Therefore in both antibiotic treatments timeliness is a crucial factor in order to effectively operate against the infection.

Stochastic model for the verification of bone pathologies
Following and extending the work in [11], we define a stochastic model for bone remodelling and perform for- mal analysis by means of probabilistic verification tech- niques, which allow to assess the probability of a particular configuration of the biological system (usually expressed as a logical formula) being reached. In our settings we derive a _Continuous Time Markov Chain_ (CTMC) from the mathematical model described above and we use the model checker PRISM [17].

<a id='34182ab6-7e1f-4725-a4ff-8abad306be06'></a>

We follow a _population-based_ approach where a state of the system is determined by the discrete density of the different cell populations involved. Osteoclasts, osteoblasts and bacteria populations are specified as _PRISM modules_, consisting of a random state variable modelling the number of individuals; and with a list of

<::chart: A 3x3 grid of line charts showing simulation results of an ODE model. The x-axis for all charts is labeled "Time [days]". Red horizontal lines indicate steady states.

Row 1: BONE DENSITY
  - Column 1 (Control vs Osteoporosis): Two lines are plotted. The solid line represents "Control", showing a relatively stable bone density around 100 with minor fluctuations. The dashed line represents "Osteoporosis", showing a gradual decrease in bone density over time, starting around 90 and falling to about 40 by 1200 days. Both lines show oscillations.
  - Column 2 (Control vs Osteomyelitis): Two lines are plotted. The solid line represents "Control", showing stable bone density around 100 with minor fluctuations. The dashed line represents "Osteomyelitis", showing an initial decrease, then some recovery, followed by a sharp decline in bone density after approximately 600 days, dropping close to 0 by 1200 days.
  - Column 3 (Osteoporosis vs Osteomyelitis): Two lines are plotted. The solid line represents "Osteoporosis", showing a gradual decrease in bone density from around 90 to about 40 by 1200 days. The dashed line represents "Osteomyelitis", showing a more rapid and pronounced decrease in bone density from around 90 to near 0 by 1200 days. Both lines show oscillations.

Row 2: OSTEOBLASTS
  - Column 1 (Control vs Osteoporosis): The y-axis ranges from 0 to 800. The solid line ("Control") shows periodic peaks around 700-800 with troughs around 100-200. The dashed line ("Osteoporosis") shows similar periodic peaks, but with slightly higher baseline and peak values, and a higher frequency of oscillations compared to control.
  - Column 2 (Control vs Osteomyelitis): The y-axis ranges from 0 to 800. The solid line ("Control") shows periodic peaks around 700-800. The dashed line ("Osteomyelitis") shows highly erratic and intense oscillations, with peaks reaching over 800 and troughs near 0, indicating unstable and long remodeling periods.
  - Column 3 (Osteoporosis vs Osteomyelitis): The y-axis ranges from 0 to 800. The solid line ("Osteoporosis") shows periodic oscillations with peaks around 700-800. The dashed line ("Osteomyelitis") shows highly erratic and intense oscillations, similar to Column 2, with peaks over 800 and troughs near 0.

Row 3: OSTEOCLASTS
  - Column 1 (Control vs Osteoporosis): The y-axis ranges from 0 to 30. The solid line ("Control") shows periodic peaks around 25 with troughs near 0. The dashed line ("Osteoporosis") shows similar periodic peaks, but with slightly higher baseline and peak values, and a higher frequency of oscillations compared to control.
  - Column 2 (Control vs Osteomyelitis): The y-axis ranges from 0 to 30. The solid line ("Control") shows periodic peaks around 25. The dashed line ("Osteomyelitis") shows highly erratic and intense oscillations, with peaks reaching over 30 and troughs near 0, indicating unstable and long remodeling periods.
  - Column 3 (Osteoporosis vs Osteomyelitis): The y-axis ranges from 0 to 30. The solid line ("Osteoporosis") shows periodic oscillations with peaks around 25. The dashed line ("Osteomyelitis") shows highly erratic and intense oscillations, similar to Column 2, with peaks over 30 and troughs near 0.::>

Figure 4 Simulation results of the ODE model. Bone density (first row), number of osteoblasts (second row), and number of osteoclasts (third
row) compared between control and osteoporotic (first column); control and osteomyelitis (second column); osteoporotic and osteomyelitis
(third column). Red lines mark the steady states for the variables considered. Results show a negative remodelling balance in the osteoporotic
case and much more critical in the osteomyelitis case. While we observe a higher (but constant) remodelling rate in the osteoporotic
configuration, in the osteomyelitis scenario the remodelling period is unstable and longer.

<::The image contains two line graphs side-by-side, with a vertical label to their right. The overall title for the right-side label is BACTERIOSTATIC TREATMENT. The left graph is titled "STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS". Its x-axis is labeled "Time [days]" ranging from 0 to 2500, and its y-axis is labeled "Num of bacteria" ranging from 0 to 80. There are three lines on the graph, each representing a different duration, indicated by a legend: 200 days (black line), 400 days (dark grey line), and 600 days (light grey line). The black line starts at 0, rises to approximately 20 bacteria by 200-300 days, and then remains constant at 20. The dark grey line starts at 0, rises to approximately 50 bacteria by 400-500 days, and then remains constant at 50. The light grey line starts at 0, rises to approximately 80 bacteria by 600-700 days, and then remains constant at 80. Each line has a circular marker at the point where it plateaus. The right graph is titled "BONE DENSITY". Its x-axis is labeled "Time [days]" ranging from 0 to 2500, and its y-axis is labeled "Density %" ranging from 0 to 120. This graph also has three lines corresponding to the same durations as the first graph: 200 days (black line), 400 days (dark grey line), and 600 days (light grey line). The black line starts around 105% density, shows an initial drop, and then oscillates with a general trend of maintaining high density, staying mostly between 80% and 100%. The dark grey line starts around 95% density, drops more significantly, and then decreases in step-like fashion, reaching around 40% by 2500 days. The light grey line starts around 90% density, drops rapidly and steadily in a step-like manner, reaching near 0% density by approximately 2000-2200 days. Each line has a circular marker near its starting point.: chart::>

<::chart: Figure 5: Simulation of bacteriostatic and bacteriocide treatments::>Figure 5 Simulation of a bacteriostatic (V = 0.005 = γB) and a bacteriocide (V = 0.007 >γB) treatment for S. Aureus at different dosage times (200, 400 and 600 days). Dots on the plots mark the points when treatment is given. As regards the bacteriostatic drug, the bone density is not subject to critical drops if the treatment is administered at t = 200 days; in the other cases, the normal remodelling activity cannot be re-established, even if the bone loss is less critical w.r.t. the untreated infection. On the other hand, the bacteriocide treatment looks more effective than the bacteriostatic one, although recovering the normal density becomes much more difficult if the drug is administered later than t = 400 days.

exponentially distributed duration of the transition with mean 1/rate (faster action have a higher probability of being taken than slower one); and _update_ optionally sets new values to state variables. The ODE model is translated into a set of PRISM guarded commands by applying the following method [18]. Consider a simple ODE population model of the form $\frac{dx}{dt} = \alpha - \beta$. The corresponding PRISM transitions would be:

<a id='7fe84398-74e4-4b0e-8894-5a8a6b6a27d0'></a>

x < x_max → α : x = x + 1
x < x_min → β : x = x - 1

<a id='c6204c30-b645-4fab-8b99-53bb570b335f'></a>

where x_max and x_min are the maximum and the mini-
mum x, resp. In other words, growth rates in the ODE
model become the stochastic rates in a transition incre-
menting the population size, while death rates are
involved in the transitions decrementing the population
size.

Table 3 summarizes the transitions of osteoclasts, osteoblasts and bacteria in the PRISM model. Moreover, in order to reduce the state-space of the stochastic model, bone density has not been implemented as a

state variable, but by means of transition rewards, i.e. positive costs associated to transitions. We implement a couple (_boneFormed_, _boneResorbed_) of rewards associated to osteoblasts' and osteoclasts' transitions where their stochastic rate is the formation rate (k₂O_b_) and the resorption rate (k₁O_c_), respectively (see Table 3).

Let assume that the simulation of the PRISM implementation of the model is run in parallel with the determination of clinical parameters during the periodic medical visits of a patient. These medical visits provide a mean of fine tuning a personalised model of the disease and a measure of how a therapy is effective. Different diseases, when monitored in a continuous way, may produce different alterations in local mineral density. We could extend the statistical estimators of a disease to: 1) the BMD (measured as z-score, the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for the

We consider the model with bacterial infection, being equivalent to the model with no infection when fᵢⱼ = 0. Guard predicates are set in order to avoid out-of-range updates and 0-valued transition rates. Maximum values for state variables have been estimated from the continuous model. The variable _treat_ is used as a switch for the beginning of treatment firing with rate 1/_t_treat, therefore with an exponentially distributed delay having mean _treatTime_. Bacteriocide (V >γB) and non-bacteriocide (V <γB) dynamics is considered separately. Bone density is calculated by subtracting the bone resorbed reward (d) from the bone formed reward (e). Resorption and formation rates in the ODE model, i.e. k₁O_c_ and k₂O_b_, respectively, become the stochastic rates of transitions incrementing the bone resorbed/formed reward.

patients age, sex and ethnicity; or as t-score, i.e. the number of standard deviations above or below the mean for a healthy 30 year old adult of the same sex and ethnicity as the patient);

2) The rate of change of BMD. This estimator tells us the emergence of defects of the bone metabolism in terms of signaling networks of RANK/RANKL and decrease of pre-osteoblast number;

3) The variance, skewness and curtosis of the the local small scale intermittency of the signal. For example osteomyelitis and osteoporosis show slightly confounding pattern of BMD decrease; we could also think at the confounding patterns of IRIS in HAART therapy, co-morbidity of osteopetrosis and osteoporosis, multiple myelomas, breast cancer, diabetes and metabolic syndromes, etc. The variance could perhaps help in discriminating among bone-related diseases. From a technical viewpoint, properties to verify have been formulated in *CSL (Continuous Stochastic Logic)* [19], and they give rise to three clinical estimators that we evaluate over 1200 days (about four years), which is enough to assess the presence of bone diseases:

<a id='aca82f2b-a5f8-423b-ba32-6553adc35326'></a>

• **Bone density estimator**. It is calculated as the difference between the cumulative ($C^{\leq t}$) expected rewards ($\mathcal{R}_{\{r^{...}\}}^{"})$ for bone formation and bone resorption, with the formula

<a id='976cae84-1a5f-4899-b6c1-e9700c097990'></a>

* Density change rate. It allows to assess rapid negative and positive changes in bone density. This estimator could be particularly helpful in detecting the insurgence of osteomyelitis before critical values of bone density are reached, since osteomyelitis is typically characterized by a higher negative change rate than osteoporosis. In particular the estimator is defined as the difference quotient of BMD over a time interval of months, e.g. 50 days. The formula obtained is

• Density variance. While the first estimator computes the expected value of bone density, here we calculate the variance of BMD taking into account the whole state space and the actual bone density at each state.

Each chart has a Y-axis labeled 'Density %' ranging from 0 to 150, and an X-axis labeled 'Time [days]' ranging from 0 to 1200. A legend in each chart indicates: 'Exp. Density' (solid line), '+- StDev' (light gray shaded area representing standard deviation), and 'ODE model' (dashed line). The overall figure is titled 'Figure 6 Bone mineral density function and its standard deviation for the control (left, a), osteoporosis (middle, b) and osteomyelitis (right, c) simulations.'

a) **BONE DENSITY - CONTROL**: This chart shows bone density for the control simulation. Both 'Exp. Density' and 'ODE model' lines fluctuate around 100% density throughout the 1200 days, with the standard deviation band centered around this level.

b) **BONE DENSITY - OSTEOPOROSIS**: This chart depicts bone density for the osteoporosis simulation. The 'Exp. Density' and 'ODE model' lines start around 100% and show a gradual decrease over time, ending around 70-80% density by 1200 days. The standard deviation band follows this downward trend.

c) **BONE DENSITY - OSTEOMYELITIS**: This chart illustrates bone density for the osteomyelitis simulation. The 'Exp. Density' and 'ODE model' lines start around 100-110% and exhibit a more significant and rapid decline, especially after 400 days, dropping to approximately 20-30% density by 1200 days. The standard deviation band is notably wider in some sections, indicating greater variability.::>

Here we report that the genetic complexity and the gene expression data meta analysis shows that the underlying "mystery" of bone remodelling is much greater than handled by the current mathematical models. In other words we are not able to use all our gene expression results in a full model of BR diseases. Although our model of osteomyelitis and the comparison with the osteoporosis is not able to consider all this complexity, nevertheless it makes a partial use of the results of the analysis of the experimental data and produces a realistic description of the pathology. From a

<a id='984eb588-e96f-4d14-9bcb-93ac9c3ae4d2'></a>

methodological point of view the combination of mathe-
matical and formal method approach has led to the pro-
posal of considering additional estimators (first
derivatives and variance) of the bone pathologies as
diagnostic tool. That could also inspire the ideal situa-
tion in which a personalised model is generated from
(personalised) data and the comparison between clinical
data obtained during periodic medical check-up is com-
pared with the computer predictions.

## Data analysis

We found that there are no comprehensive analysis on osteomyelitis; most studies focus on specific conditions. We have collected a large ensemble of gene expression data related to osteomyelitis and osteoporosis. For this reason, we have considered 6 microarray data sets of the

Each chart displays a fluctuating line representing density change over time. Chart (a) is labeled 'DENSITY CHANGE RATE - CONTROL'. Chart (b) is labeled 'DENSITY CHANGE RATE - OSTEOPOROSIS'.

bers are GSE16129, GSE6269, GSE11907, GSE11908,

RANKL, RANK, OPG and NF-kB proteins impact more
on the bone remodelling for osteomyelitis and osteo-
porosis [7,20-22]. For this reason to understand the
effect osteomyelitis and osteoporosis on bone remodel-
ling, we have considered the genes related to the pro-
teins RANKL, RANK, OPG, NF-kB proteins, TNF and
TNF receptor superfamilies. We observed that there are
82 genes are related with these proteins. So, we filtered
the required 82 genes related data. We have selected
samples for 48 infected and 27 healthy controls for
osteomyelitis and 30 infected and 30 healthy controls
for osteoporosis. The datasets contain data from people
of different age and sex.

For more evidence about osteomyelitis, we have considered more gene expression data related to osteomyelitis on different platform GPL97. For this reason, we have considered additional 3 microarray data sets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), accession numbers are GSE6269, GSE11907 and GSE11908 [21,22]. To understand the effect of osteomyelitis on the bone remodelling, we have considered the genes related to the proteins RANKL, RANK, OPG, NF-kB proteins, TNF and TNF receptor superfamilies like previous analysis. We observed that in the platform GPL97, there are 31 genes are related to these proteins and superfamilies. So, we filtered the required genes related data. We have selected samples for 43 infected and 17 healthy controls. Standard anova and Box plots representation were used to analyse and visualise the expression levels of these genes for the infection of osteomyelitis and osteoporosis condition. We output in Table 1 the groups of over expressed and under expressed categories.

ODE and probabilistic model checking models
We have implemented the ODE model based on
Komarova et al [10] in R, and using the *FME* package
[24] to analyse parameter sensitivity and robustness. We
have used *Mathematica* and *MATLAB* for steady states
and ODE calculation using state of art numerical rou-
tines. Scripts and functions for the models could be
made available upon request to the first author. For the
specification of the stochastic model and for performing
probabilistic verification we have adopted the open-
source PRISM probabilistic model checker [17], one of
the reference existing model checkers for the analysis of
systems which exhibits random or probabilistic beha-
viour. Since model checking is based on graph-theoreti-
cal techniques for exploring the whole state space of the
model, this task becomes computationally infeasible for

<a id='44d44d8a-d70e-4ea9-8c5e-d47143d054c1'></a>

non-trivial models, due to the combinatorial explosion of the state space. For this reason, verification has been performed by means of _approximate probabilistic model checking_ techniques that calculate the probability of a given property on a statistical basis, i.e. by sampling on a number of simulations of the model. In this work we have taken 20 samples for each verified property, that were enough to reproduce outputs similar to the non-approximate verification. PRISM models could be made available upon request to the second author.
