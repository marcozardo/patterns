# Abstract

Vascular endothelium expressing endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces nitric oxide (NO), which has a number of important physiological functions in the microvasculature. The rate of NO production by the endothelium is a critical determinant of NO distribution in the vascular wall. We have analyzed the biochemical pathways of NO synthesis and formulated a model to estimate NO production by the microvascular endothelium under physiological conditions. The model quantifies the NO produced by eNOS based on the kinetics of NO synthesis and the availability of eNOS and its intracellular substrates. The predicted NO production from microvessels was in the range of 0.005–0.1 µM/s. This range of predicted values is in agreement with some experimental values but is much lower than other rates previously measured or estimated from experimental data with the help of mathematical modeling. Paradoxical discrepancies between the model predictions and previously reported results based on experimental measurements of NO concentration in the vicinity of the arteriolar wall suggest that NO can also be released through eNOS-independent mechanisms, such as catalysis by neuronal NOS (nNOS). We also used our model to test the sensitivity of NO production to substrate availability, eNOS concentration, and potential rate-limiting factors. The results indicated that the predicted low level of NO production can be attributed primarily to a low expression of eNOS in the microvascular endothelial cells.

## Introduction

Nitric oxide (NO) is an uncharged free radical compound with diverse physiological and pathological functions, including prevention of leukocyte adhesion, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and the host response to infection [1]. In addition, NO is a potent vasodilator that regulates vascular smooth muscle tone [2]. NO that diffuses into smooth muscle cells activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which catalyzes the formation of 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Many

cardiovascular diseases, including hypertension, atherosclero-
sis, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, can be induced by
the abnormal production and transport of NO in the vasculature
[3,4].

NO can be endogenously synthesized in a number of cells, including endothelial cells (ECs). L-Arginine is degraded to L-citrulline and NO through a five-electron oxidation reaction in the presence of molecular oxygen and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) [1]. This process is catalyzed by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). To date, three isoforms of NOS have been identified: neuronal NOS (nNOS, or NOS 1), inducible NOS (iNOS, or NOS 2), and endothelial NOS (eNOS, or NOS 3) [1,5]. nNOS and eNOS are constitutive enzymes controlled by the activity of intracellular Ca2+/calmodulin. iNOS is an inducible enzyme that is controlled at the level of gene transcription. It is synthesized in the immune system in response to inflammatory or proinflammatory mediators [1]. All isoforms of NOS are heme-containing enzymes that require coenzymes/cofactors for full activity, including flavin

mononucleotide (FMN), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD),
and tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B). Among the three isoforms,
eNOS has been considered to be the major source that produces
vasodilating NO. In this study, we focus on the NO production
catalyzed by eNOS.

Different approaches have been used to study the vasodilatory effect of NO on the cardiovascular system. Theoretical modeling is an important tool that has been used to gain an understanding of how NO is transported from its source(s) to the blood vessel wall, where it produces vascular smooth muscle relaxation. The rate of NO production by the endothelium is a critical parameter that is affected by many factors, including the biochemical and mechanical microenvironment of the ECs.
Because NO is synthesized through a complex metabolic network and then spontaneously and rapidly oxidized to nitrite and nitrate in oxygenated physiological solutions, unambiguous experimental determination of NO distribution is difficult, especially for the microvessels. Thus, theoretical modeling provides a useful tool to increase our understanding of the physiological roles of NO and to guide the design of experiments investigating the simultaneous production and diffusion of NO and its rapid reactions with various species, including superoxide, hemoglobin, and sGC. Lancaster [6] was the first to use a mathematical model to simulate the diffusion, chemical reactions, and production of NO in a system mimicking the endothelium. Vaughn et al. [7] formulated a mathematical model that included a geometric model of ECs and also fit the experimental findings of Malinski et al. [8]. Using their model, they estimated the NO production per unit area and per unit time from ECs lining blood vessels, as well as the NO diffusion rate in the vascular region. Several subsequent models have also been based on the measurements of Malinski et al. and the estimates of Vaughn et al. [9-13]. Moreover, other in vitro and in vivo experiments using a variety of methods have suggested different NO production rates that span a wide range [14-17].

<a id='92fe9cac-6fba-46d8-8f65-a89a5deacffd'></a>

We have now analyzed the biochemical pathways of NO synthesis in ECs under physiological conditions and propose a theoretical/computational model that provides quantitative predictions of NO production by the vascular endothelium. The uniqueness of this work is that we have modeled the NO production process under physiological conditions at the cellular level, with a focus on NO production catalyzed by eNOS.

# Model formulation

## Geometry

The geometry of an EC is modeled as a pancake-shaped ellipsoid [7]. The radius (r₁) of the ellipsoid is in the range of 10–20 µm on the “pancake overlook” surface, but the thickness (r₂) is much smaller (0.5–1 µm). We used the volume of an EC to calculate the NO production per unit volume. Experimentally, Haas and Duling [18] estimated the volume of an EC to be 400 µm³ in hamster arterioles. However, it has been found that the size of ECs from arterioles with different diameters may vary [18,19]. Therefore, because of the uncertainty regarding

<a id='dc39cf60-822a-4f5b-8fcd-2fc52d5bd0d7'></a>

cell size, we examined a range of intracellular eNOS concentrations.

<a id='d3c74a98-1ddb-435f-8cfa-47f4f15d3320'></a>

It has been reported that the majority of intracellular eNOS (67%) is bound to the membrane of the EC [20], and only a small portion is cytoplasmic. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that eNOS is uniformly distributed on the EC membrane and that the NO production mainly occurs in the compartment adjacent to the EC surface. The thickness of this compartment can be assumed to be ~10 nm (a typical protein dimension), and the eNOS concentration in the compartment is thus higher than the overall intracellular concentration. We will see that the calculated NO release rate based on the compartmental distribution of eNOS is the same as that obtained when we consider eNOS to be uniformly distributed in the entire EC. Once NO is released, it diffuses rapidly out of the compartment because of its high diffusion coefficient [6,7]. Thus, we considered the biochemical reactions for the synthesis of NO in the ECs and ignored the transport of all reactants and products through the cellular membrane, with the exception of NO.

The pathway of NO synthesis in endothelial cells

L-Arginine, O2, and NADPH are the substrates for NO syn-
thesis. In the first reaction step, NOS catalyzes the Nω-hydro-
xylation of the guanidine group of L-arginine to form Nω-
hydroxyl-L-arginine (NOHA), an intermediate product. NOHA
then is further oxidized to L-citrulline and NO in a reaction
catalyzed by eNOS. The chemical equation for the overall
reaction is:

<a id='6a957c78-397c-4689-9b1b-9a695e0ea07e'></a>

L-Arginine + 2O2 + 1.5NADPH NOS L-Citrulline + NO + 1.5NADP+ + 2H2O.

<a id='986bbed2-e750-4367-b4c0-4becd8002b38'></a>

FMN, FAD, and H4B are required as coenzymes for NOS, and Ca2+/calmodulin and mechanical stimuli (e.g., wall shear stress) can alter the catalytic activity of eNOS [1,5]. Human eNOS is an enzyme with a molecular weight of 133 kDa [1]. Each eNOS molecule consists of two domains: a C-terminal reductase domain and an N-terminal oxygenase domain. There is a core region of eNOS between the C- and the N-terminal to which substrates L-arginine and O2 bind. The reductase and oxygenase domains, acting together, catalyze NO production through sequential electron transfer and oxidation of L-arginine. The C-terminal reductase domain binds FAD, FMN, and NADPH. NADPH contributes electrons, which are further transferred by FAD and FMN to the oxygenase domain. The electrons are then transferred to the heme group iron of eNOS under the regulation of H4B. The heme iron undergoes a series of redox reactions. The apparent values for eNOS activity, including Vmax and Km values for substrates and coenzymes, have been reported by a variety of laboratories (e.g., [21,22]) and are summarized in Table 1.

<a id='b0cbe2cf-ff21-42a7-8531-40a6281c21fa'></a>

We now describe the chemical reactions that result in NO
release (Fig. 1). The mechanisms and kinetics of eNOS catalysis
have been investigated (see [23-27]), and the catalytic
mechanism has been characterized as a five-electron transfer
reaction cycle that produces NO. Briefly, L-arginine binds to
eNOS in a reversible manner. The reductase domain of eNOS

The values are for characterized eNOS from cultured ECs. C is the
concentration; Vmax is the maximum rate of eNOS-catalyzed production of
NO; Km is the Michaelis constant, the concentration of the substrate required for
the enzyme to reach one-half maximum velocity; EC50 is the concentration of
coenzymes required for eNOS to reach one-half Vmax.

also takes electrons from NADPH. This step is fast when the
coenzyme Ca²⁺/calmodulin is bound to eNOS [28] and we have
ignored it in the kinetics. Another substrate, O₂, binds to the
heme iron to form a heme-dioxy intermediate Fe²⁺—O₂, which
is immediately converted to the ferric superoxy species Fe³⁺—
O₂⁻ [5,27]. For our purposes, we used Fe²⁺—O₂ or Fe³⁺—O₂⁻
interchangeably and ignored the rapid transition between them.
Moreover, experiments have shown that, through dissociation
of the heme-dioxy species, O₂⁻ can be generated from the

<a id='757cace7-f470-442b-8bff-7c1a28b58107'></a>

oxygenase domain under certain conditions, but the O2
generation is prevented by the concomitant addition of L-
arginine and H4B [5,29]. In our model, we assumed that the
intracellular concentrations of the substrate L-arginine and
coenzyme H4B are sufficiently high and ignored the dissoci-
ation of O2 from the eNOS heme. Similarly, the possible
nitroxyl generation by eNOS was also ignored because of the
presence of coenzyme H4B [30,31]. After the heme-dioxy
species is formed, the hydroxylation of the guanidine group of
L-arginine is then completed with the formation of NOHA.
With the NOHA bound, the heme iron group of eNOS under-
goes the same heme reduction and oxygen binding that oc-
cur when L-arginine is bound, and L-citrulline and the
complex Fe³⁺NO are formed. This bound NO is then released
from Fe³⁺NO. Meanwhile, Fe³⁺NO can be reduced to Fe²⁺NO,
which is further oxidized by O2 to nitrate plus ferric eNOS.
The bound NO on the ferrous heme can also potentially be
released, but we have ignored this release because this release
is very slow.

<a id='eea29e5c-7dc6-4276-8aca-40e151566b13'></a>

From Table 1, we can see that the typical intracellular concentrations of H4B and calmodulin are far larger than those required for eNOS to reach its 50% maximal catalytic activity, but the Ca2+ concentration varies over a relatively wide range. To simplify the model illustrated in Fig. 1, we assumed that all coenzymes were present in excess and ignored their effects on the kinetics of eNOS catalysis, although the variation in their availability might affect the kinetics of certain steps in the catalysis. As described later, we also tested the dependence of

<::Reaction scheme showing multiple interconnected biochemical pathways involving Arg, Fe, and NO, with various intermediates and rate constants. The scheme can be broadly divided into several sections:

**Top Left Section:**
*   Arg reacts with Fe³⁺(H₄B) in an equilibrium reaction with rate constants k₁ and k₁'.
*   Fe³⁺(H₄B) accepts an electron (e⁻) with rate constant k₂ to become Fe²⁺(H₄B).
*   Arg reacts with Fe²⁺(H₄B) with rate constant k₃ to form Arg Fe²⁺(H₄B).
*   Arg Fe²⁺(H₄B) can react with an electron (e⁻) via k₃' to form Fe³⁺(H₄B) and Arg.
*   Arg Fe²⁺(H₄B) can also react via k₄ with an electron (e⁻) to form Arg Fe³⁺(H₄B).

**Top Middle/Right Section (leading to first dashed box):**
*   Arg Fe³⁺(H₄B) (from the previous section) reacts with O₂ with rate constants k₅ and k₅' (equilibrium) to form Arg Fe²⁺O₂ or Fe³⁺O₂⁻ (H₄B⁺).
*   Arg Fe²⁺O₂ or Fe³⁺O₂⁻ (H₄B⁺) then reacts via k₆ to enter a dashed box, forming Arg Fe³⁺-O-OH (H₃B⁻).

**First Dashed Box (top right):**
*   Arg Fe³⁺-O-OH (H₃B⁻) loses H₂O to form R-C=NH Fe⁴⁺=O (H₃B⁻).
*   R-C=NH Fe⁴⁺=O (H₃B⁻) transforms into NOHA Fe³⁺ (H₃B⁻).

*   Fe³⁺NO (H₄B) transforms via k₁₂ to Fe²⁺NO (H₄B).
*   Fe²⁺NO (H₄B) reacts with O₂ via k₁₃ to form Fe³⁺ and NO₃⁻.

**Bottom Left Section (second dashed box):**
*   NOHA Fe³⁺-O-O⁻ (H₄B⁺) is formed from the right side of the dashed box (k₁₁). It is then oxidized by NOS (H₄B⁺) to produce Citrulline + H₂O and NOHA.

**Bottom Right Section (NOHA pathways):**

The aforementioned binding kinetics are represented by a set of ordinary differential equations, Eqs. (1)-(15). The equations describing the change in species concentration with time are conceptually similar to those formulated earlier [23] but are extended to the binding kinetics of L-arginine and O2 under physiological conditions, in order to quantify NO production by ECs. The iron heme group represents eNOS in different states, Arg represents L-arginine, and [Fe·Arg] or [Fe·NOHA] represents the species generated when eNOS is bound to Arg or NOHA, respectively. The term S in Eq. (1) represents the rate of L-arginine supply transported from the outside of ECs to supplement the consumption [32]. We assumed that the transported L-arginine exactly equals the amount consumed and thus there is no net change of L-arginine over time (d[Arg]/dt = 0). Moreover, the effect produced by the consumption of NADPH is ignored in the kinetic equations because the electron transfer from NADPH is rapid when Ca2+/calmodulin is bound [28] and the intracellular concentration of NADPH (Table 1) is much higher than that of eNOS. The change in O2, including its delivery from the blood to the endothelium as a substrate required for the reactions involving eNOS, is not included in the equations because the concentration of the O2 reservoir is usually much larger than that of eNOS and can be quickly replenished once some is consumed. Moreover, the mechanisms of electron and proton donation by H4B when either L-arginine or NOHA is bound (indicated by the dotted boxes in Fig. 1) have not been totally resolved. However, single turnover experiments [26] have shown that the H4B radical formation rate matches the rate of L-arginine hydroxylation, indicating that the rate of NOHA production is limited by the H4B electron donation step after O2 binds to eNOS. This is also assumed to be true for the steps when NOHA is bound. Thus, the catalytic steps shown inside the dotted boxes in Fig. 1 were ignored in the equations, and the products immediately after them were considered.

binding rates to eNOS were reported to be 0.2 and 0.8 μM⁻¹ s⁻¹ at 4 and 23°C, respectively, while the apparent dissociation rates were 0.08 and 1.6 s⁻¹ at 4 and 23°C, respectively [33]. The ferric heme reduction rate was estimated to be 0.17 s⁻¹ with the presence of sufficient NADPH at 10°C [24]. Given that the regeneration of H4B in the catalysis cycle requires one electron from the reductase domain, we took 0.11 s⁻¹, which was lower by 33% from 0.17 s⁻¹, as the apparent heme reduction rate. The rate at which one O2 molecule binds to the heme iron to form a heme-dioxy intermediate, Fe²⁺O2 or Fe³⁺O2⁻, was determined to be 0.34 μM⁻¹ s⁻¹ at 10°C [28] and 0.265 μM⁻¹ s⁻¹ at 7°C [34]. In the equations, we used only Fe³⁺O2⁻ to represent this intermediate product. The off-rate of O2 from the heme-dioxy intermediate was 28 s⁻¹ at 10°C [28] and 24 s⁻¹ at 7°C [34]. The reaction rate for the steps in the dotted box in Fig. 1 when L-arginine was bound was 6.7 s⁻¹ at 10°C in single turnover experiments with the formation of NOHA [26]. With the intermediate product NOHA bound, the reduction rate of eNOS ferric heme was the same as that when L-arginine was bound (0.11 s⁻¹ at 10°C) [24]. The subsequent O2 binding rate has been reported as 0.26 μM⁻¹ s⁻¹ at 10°C [28] and 0.342 μM⁻¹ s⁻¹ at 7°C [34]. The O2 off-rate for this step was reported to be 18 s⁻¹ at 10°C [24] and 22 s⁻¹ at 7°C [34]. The reaction rate for the steps in the dotted box when NOHA was bound was 14.5 s⁻¹ at 7°C in single turnover experiments with the formation of L-citrulline [34]. The range of apparent rates for NOHA dissociation and rebinding to NOS has been estimated to be similar to those for L-arginine binding and dissociation [35,36]. NOHA has been reported to represent only a small fraction of

<a id='c107e2a3-6215-407c-b2d5-5fcfe9892ee6'></a>

the metabolic products of NOS catalysis under both basal and stimulated conditions [37]. From Fig. 1, we can see that NOHA is insignificant as a metabolite only when the NOHA dissociation occurs primarily at the ferrous heme site, because otherwise a large amount of NOHA is released from the ferric heme before it is relatively slowly reduced to the ferrous form. Our parameter analysis showed that when k₈ is 0.1 s⁻¹ and k₉ is 11.4 s⁻¹ (the sum of k₈ and k₉ being equal to the measured apparent dissociation rate scaled to 37°C; see below), the calculated portion of NOHA among all metabolites was consistent with the experimental finding by Buga et al. [37]. Thus, we chose 0.1 s⁻¹ as k₈ and 11.4 s⁻¹ as k₉, and, for association rates, 0.1 µM⁻¹ s⁻¹ as k'₈ and 1.89 µM⁻¹ s⁻¹ as k'₉ (the sum of k'₈ and k'₉ being equal to the measured apparent association rate) at 37°C. For the rate of dissociation of NO from Fe³⁺NO, it was measured as 3.5 s⁻¹ at 10°C [24] and 2.5 s⁻¹ at 7°C [34]. The rate of reduction from Fe³⁺NO to Fe²⁺NO and the rate of oxidation of Fe²⁺NO were 0.11 s⁻¹ and 0.00429 µM⁻¹ s⁻¹, respectively, at 10°C [24].

The values of kinetic parameters described above were measured in vitro at various temperatures, usually under lower than physiological conditions, in order to match the in vitro experimental conditions. No rate constants measured at 37°C were found in the literature. Thus, the kinetic parameters measured at lower temperatures needed to be scaled to approximate the values at 37°C in order to describe the reactions that occur under physiological conditions.

where *k*<sub>T1</sub> is the kinetic parameter at temperature *T*<sub>1</sub>, *k*<sub>T2</sub> is the kinetic parameter at temperature *T*<sub>2</sub>, *E*<sub>a</sub> is the activation energy of the reaction, and *R* is the universal gas constant (8.3144 J·mol<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>). Activation energies have not been measured for the reactions during the enzymatic synthesis of NO. However, as shown in Table 2, several parameters have been reported at multiple temperatures, enabling us to back-calculate *E*<sub>a</sub> for the corresponding reaction and then scale up to 37°C. For those parameters measured at only one temperature, assumptions were needed. Moreover, the values of *k*<sub>10</sub> and *k*'<sub>10</sub> reported at 7°C are larger than those at 10°C, perhaps reflecting experimental variability. However, we noted that the O<sub>2</sub> binding to ferrous heme (*k*<sub>5</sub> and *k*<sub>10</sub>), O<sub>2</sub> dissociation from the dioxy- heme (*k*'<sub>5</sub> and *k*'<sub>10</sub>), and the catalytic conversion from Fe<sup>3+</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> to ferric heme (*k*<sub>6</sub> and *k*<sub>11</sub>) with L-arginine or NOHA bound were structurally similar. Thus, we assumed that the activation energies for these three steps when NOHA was bound to eNOS were the same as for the corresponding steps when L-arginine is bound. For the steps of ferric heme reductions, NO binding to ferric heme, and the oxidation of Fe<sup>2+</sup>NO to form ferric heme plus nitrate, the activation energies were assumed to be the average of all the available reactions. The approximate values scaled to 37°C are listed in Table 2. Clearly, some of the above assumptions represent extrapolations in the absence of more

definitive data. As shown in our supplemental material, we
explored the sensitivity of the parameters within a wide range
and found that the NO production rate was not considerably
affected when a single parameter, with the exception of the
heme reduction rate, was altered (supplemental materials,
Table S1). In addition, we tested another parameter scaling
method—we took the average of activation energies of the
reaction steps that can be back-calculated and applied the
averaged value to each step to scale the parameters. The
calculated NO production rates based on these two scaling
methods were close to each other (less than ~6% difference,
supplemental materials, Fig. S1).

The intracellular concentration of L-arginine in ECs has been reported to be ~100 µM or even higher [38]. However, the availability of L-arginine to eNOS for NO synthesis is complicated by the phenomenon known as the "L-arginine paradox" [39]. Table 1 shows that the concentration of L-arginine that is required by eNOS to reach 50% maximal activity, Km, is as small as 3 µM. This value is several-fold lower than the intracellular concentration of L-arginine (Table 1). Thus, it appears that an increase in external L-arginine should not affect NO production. However, experiments in vitro with cultured ECs [40] and in vivo [41,42] have shown that increasing the intake of L-arginine further increases NO production. One hypothesis to explain the L-arginine paradox is that even though the intracellular L-arginine concentration is high, it is divided into different "pools" or compartments, and only the compartment associated with membrane is accessible to NOS [39,40]. Thus, only the amount designated as λ[L-arginine] is accessible to NOS, where [L-arginine] is the intracellular concentration of L-arginine (about 100 µM, Table 2) and 0 < λ < 1. We varied the value of λ to assess how different possible levels of accessibility of the compartmental-ized L-arginine affect the NO production.

<a id='ef8251b7-80ef-4610-91e5-9238079985be'></a>

The concentration of another substrate, O2, varies in different blood vessels. For example, in a large arteriole of the cat, the periarteriolar oxygen concentration is 172 µM (pO2 99 mm Hg) [43]. The oxygen concentration decreases to 127 µM (73 mm Hg) in smaller arterioles with a diameter of 22 µm. The oxygen concentration in venules is in the 50–80 µM range [44]. Thus, for a given tissue, the dissolved O2 concentration in aqueous solution is considerably larger than the eNOS concentration under physiological conditions (Table 2). Moreover, the consumption of O2 in ECs can be quickly supplemented by delivery from the blood. Thus, O2 serves as a reservoir in our calculations, and the concentration of the substrate O2 is input as a constant for a given blood vessel. Therefore, the change in O2 concentration with respect to time is not included in the governing equations.

With regard to eNOS, several measurements of the intracellular concentration of eNOS in ECs are available. Andersen et al. [45] measured the eNOS levels in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) from maternal smokers and nonsmokers and obtained values of 2.5 ± 1.9 ng eNOS/106 ECs for nonsmokers, which is equivalent to (1.88 ± 1.43) × 10-20 mol eNOS / EC when we take the molecular weight of eNOS to be 133 kDa [1]. Assuming the

<a id='946b9f6e-c80c-4925-a7d7-fb1490457b58'></a>

average volume of an EC to be 400 µm³, the intracellular concentration of eNOS in HUVECs was 0.047 ± 0.036 µM. Lubrano et al. [46] reported that the eNOS levels are 41 ± 14 pg eNOS / 10⁵ ECs for HUVECs and 121 ± 8 pg eNOS /10⁵ ECs for normal human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs), which are equivalent to 0.008 ± 0.003 and 0.023 ± 0.002 µM, respectively. The manual for the eNOS Quantikine Immunoas- say Kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) quotes eNOS concentrations in HUVECs and HMVECs of 5137 pg/10⁶ ECs (0.097 µM) and 1396 pg/10⁶ ECs (0.026 µM), respectively. Given the variation in EC size in arterioles [18,19], we have considered a range of eNOS concentrations in arteriolar endothelium of 0.015 to 0.045 µM.

*Comparison of the calculated NO production rates based on the entire EC volume and the compartmental volume*

<a id='7bf4861b-5089-4f63-bcc8-c41185ad2954'></a>

We first tested whether the compartmentalized distribution of eNOS affects the NO production in our model. We solved Eqs. (1)-(15) and calculated the NO production rate (d[NO]/dt, as described in Eq. (12)) based on the total eNOS in the entire EC or just in the compartments. For the compartmental case, the eNOS was considered to be contained within the 10-nm layer below the plasma membrane. After the NO was produced, the NO production rate was normalized by the entire cell volume. Our calculations showed that the two NO production rates from the two models were virtually the same at all time points, indicating that there was minimal difference when the two distribution models were considered. As we will see later, this is because of the linear relationship between NO production and eNOS availability when substrates are present in excess.

<a id='2d2ed971-63bd-48dd-80ba-6febc7ec7362'></a>

Thus, we ignored any difference regarding how eNOS is distributed inside ECs. We also ignored the difference in catalytic kinetics between the membrane-bound eNOS and the cytoplasmic eNOS in our model, although they may not be the same. Thus, unless otherwise indicated, we performed the computations based on the entire cell volume, and the NO production rate described in this study was presented as the NO produced per unit time per unit EC volume.

_Predictions of NO production rates_

We used the model to estimate NO production under the conditions typical for arterioles and venules. Because of the variations in the measured eNOS intracellular concentrations, multiple eNOS concentrations in the reported ranges were used.

In the arteriolar endothelium, we used 0.045, 0.030, and 0.015 µM as eNOS concentrations to quantify NO production; in the venular endothelium, we used 0.097, 0.053, and 0.008 µM (Fig. 2). The distribution of substrate O₂ varies in arterioles and venules of different sizes. For this step, we took the midpoint of the O₂ concentration ranges shown in Table 2 as a first approximation. The sensitivity to O₂ will be discussed later. For another substrate, L-arginine, we used 100 µM as its concentration [39,40]. We will also discuss the sensitivity of NO production to the availability of L-arginine later. The initial condition was set such that all eNOS was in the ferric form, and L-arginine was not yet bound to eNOS. Figs. 2A and 2B show that the system quickly reached the quasi-steady state (~2 s) and then released NO at a nearly constant rate. In arterioles, the NO production rate was in the range of 5–17 × 10⁻³ µM/s after quasi-steady state was reached. In venules, NO was released at a rate in the range of 3–34 × 10⁻³ µM/s in the quasi-steady state. Moreover, the concentrations of all intermediate eNOS species (Fe³⁺, Fe²⁺, Fe³⁺·Arg, Fe²⁺·Arg, Fe³⁺·O₂⁻·Arg, Fe³⁺·NOHA, Fe²⁺·NOHA, Fe³⁺·O₂⁻·NOHA, Fe³⁺·NO, and Fe²⁺·NO) were unchanged after the system reached the quasi-steady state while the reaction products (citrulline, NOHA, nitrate, and NO) increased linearly (supplemental materials, Fig. S2).

calculated the NO production rate with different initial conditions corresponding to different forms of eNOS (ferric, ferrous, dioxy-heme, etc.) and found that they converged to the same quasi-steady state value of NO release (supplemental materials, Fig. S3). Thus, the choice of initial condition did not affect the NO release rate in the quasi-steady state.

Sensitivity of NO production to the availability of eNOS

We also tested the dependence of NO production on eNOS concentration when all other conditions were kept unchanged. The concentrations of L-arginine and O2 were set to 100 and 150 µM, respectively. The system reached the quasi-steady state quickly. When we varied the concentration of eNOS from 0.005 to 5 µM (data not shown), the NO production rate increased linearly with the increase in intracellular eNOS concentration. This result is consistent with the prediction from enzymology that the enzyme concentration and product formation are linearly related. Thus, increasing the availability of eNOS can significantly increase NO production.

Sensitivity of NO production to the availability of the substrates
O2 and L-arginine

We also evaluated the NO production in response to varying
concentrations of O2 and L-arginine. Fig. 3 shows how NO
production changed with different substrate concentrations (1-
100 µM for L-arginine and 1-200 µM for O2) when either O2 or
L-arginine was kept constant. In our model, we ignored the
consumption of NOHA by other species for simplicity.
Therefore, when both O2 and L-arginine concentrations were
low (<10 µM), the system could not reach the quasi-steady state
because of the influence by the accumulation of NOHA. In this
case, we took the NO production rate at 10 s. Fig. 3 shows that
NO production rate was insensitive to the concentration of L-
arginine when [L-arginine] > ~5 µM. However, when the
concentration was low (<5 µM), NO production rapidly
decreased with decreasing concentration of L-arginine. Thus,
in intact cells, if only a small portion of intracellular L-arginine
(0 < λ < 0.05) is in the pool accessible to eNOS as suggested in
the hypothesis in [39,40], applying supplemental L-arginine to
ECs can further increase the NO production through the
increase of the L-arginine accessible to eNOS. For the substrate
O2, NO production was less sensitive to O2 concentration when
[O2] was high (> ~80 µM), but became more sensitive to [O2]
change when pO2 was low, indicating that under hypoxic
conditions (low pO2), the release of NO is significantly
decreased.

The inset of Fig. 3 shows how we estimated the concentration of either O2 or L-arginine required to yield one-half maximum NO production (Km) while the availability of the other substrate was fixed. The Km for O2 was estimated to be in the range of 11.0-11.5 M when the concentration of available L-arginine varied from 20 to 100 M. Similarly, the Km value for L-arginine was estimated to be ~0.5 M when the concentration of available O2 varied from 50 to 200 M. The apparent Km for O2 measured experimentally is 7.7 M, and the

<a id='5f18574e-3126-4378-89a7-e73f9f3ef5b6'></a>

Perturbations of the kinetic parameters may have influ-ences on the NO release rate. The analysis of parameter sensitivity (supplemental materials, Table S1) showed that the final NO release rate is insensitive to the variability of most kinetic parameters except the heme reduction rates (ferric heme iron reduced to ferrous heme, expressed by k2, k3, k7, and k12 as the kinetic parameters in Table 2 and Fig. 1). The heme reduction steps appear to be the slowest steps provided the substrates O2 and L-arginine are present at relatively large concentrations. A larger heme reduction rate could increase the process of eNOS synthesizing NO. Moreover, we have scaled the heme reduction rate to 37°C using an estimated activation energy equal to the average of all available activation energies of the reactions in the NO synthesis pathway. This estimation may introduce errors to the description of the kinetics. In addition, external stimulation, such as shear stress and bradykinin, are likely to change the heme reduction rate [5]. Fig. 4 examines the possible range of NO production upon the variability of the rate-limiting rates while all other parameters were kept unchanged. A wide range of values of the heme reduction rate was tested, from 0.2 to 22 s⁻¹. Fig. 4 shows that a 20-fold increase in heme reduction rate from 0.91 to 18 s⁻¹ resulted in a 6-fold increase of NO production. When the heme reduction rate was around 18 s⁻¹, NO production reached the optimal value and further increase of the heme reduction rate did not result

<a id='5902ebba-0b99-495e-9c07-1a9e69df7a5a'></a>

in higher NO production due to the balance of eNOS pattern
distribution in the quasi-steady state, as discussed by Stuehr
and colleagues [5]. Thus, the NO production by ECs can
reach as high as ~0.1 µM/s when the rate-limiting kinetic
parameter is altered upon stimulation (e.g., shear stress,
bradykinin).

_The feedback inhibition on NO production by NO binding to eNOS heme_

<a id='38213f85-ff78-4f36-be1a-83335952ca78'></a>

Our model thus far has ignored the competitive binding of free NO to eNOS heme as a feedback regulation. We now consider how the NO production is affected by this mechanism. NO can bind to ferric and ferrous heme of eNOS, with binding rates of 0.82 and 1.1 µM⁻¹ s⁻¹ at 10°C, respectively [28]. The corresponding values at 37°C were scaled to be 6.5 µM⁻¹ s⁻¹(k'14) and 8.8 µM⁻¹ s⁻¹(k'15), respectively, using Eq. (16) with the average of activation energies from known steps as discussed under Model formulation. The equation system (Eqs. (1)-(15)) was modified to accommodate the effect of NO binding to heme: a new term of -k'14[NO][Fe³⁺] was inserted into Eq. (2), -k'15 [NO][Fe²⁺] was inserted into Eq. (4), k'14[NO][Fe³⁺] was inserted into Eq. (10), k'15[NO][Fe²⁺] was inserted into Eq. (11), and -k'14[NO][Fe³⁺]-k'15[NO][Fe²⁺] was inserted into Eq. (12). Fig. 5 shows the calculated NO production with and without the feedback inhibition effect by NO accumulation. When the feedback inhibition was considered, NO production was not considerably different from that when there was no feedback for the first 15 s and was reduced by only ~5% after 60 s, presumably because of the low accumulation level of NO (~1 µM at 60 s). Given the fact that NO possesses a short half-life time (~4 s) and a high diffusion coefficient (3300 µm²/s) under physiological conditions [6], the negative feedback control on NO catalysis through NO binding to eNOS heme does not have a significant effect on NO production from the endothelium. However, under some circumstances where high concentration of NO is accumulated, such as certain pathophysiological conditions, the

## Discussion

In this study, we have used a kinetic model based on NO synthesis pathway analysis to quantify NO production by the endothelium. The parameters were scaled to a temperature level (37°C) that mimics physiological conditions. NO production was calculated, and the sensitivity of NO production to various parameters was also explored.

_Comparison to the results from the analysis of the apparent activities of eNOS_

<a id='eb2687e1-de10-4798-97fd-66c2ac124798'></a>

Having quantified NO production from the vascular endothelium through biochemical pathway analysis, we then compared these predictions to the results of an analysis of the apparent activities. Although the apparent catalytic activity of an enzyme depends on its cellular milieu, the values obtained still point to a range of levels of NO production by eNOS.
Based on the apparent activities and the intracellular concentration of eNOS, the NO production can be estimated using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Inside the EC, the maximum NO production rate (RNO,max), when eNOS reaches its full activity and sufficient concentrations of substrates and coenzymes are available, can be expressed as the product of the intracellular concentration of eNOS, CeNOS, and the maximum catalytic rate, Vc,max,

<a id='4f63366a-8338-426d-b72a-7d106e1ee972'></a>

$R_{NO,max} = \frac{dC_{NO}}{dt} = C_{eNOS} \cdot V_{c,max},$ (17)

<a id='a8743153-d11f-4387-9c9f-a057bfe64179'></a>

where C_NO is the concentration of NO. Several groups (e.g., [22,47]) have purified eNOS to high levels and measured the activity of eNOS by monitoring the conversion of L-[³H] arginine to L-[³H]citrulline. An extensive literature search revealed that the highest reported V_c,max was 0.585 µmol min⁻¹ (mg of protein)⁻¹, obtained by Liu et al. [22].

<a id='f8db93b7-727a-466c-a419-d577de3cec40'></a>

The availability of the substrates regulates NO production. Because the intracellular concentration of eNOS (as shown in Table 2) is on the order of 0.01 µM, a value much smaller than the concentrations of the three substrates under typical cellular conditions, the Michaelis-Menten equation can be used to describe the initial rate of NO production catalyzed by eNOS under various conditions. The initial velocity is

<a id='c253badf-ffbf-4aa9-8d1f-eaedeaf78fdd'></a>

R_NO = \frac{R_{NO,max} C_{substrate}}{(K_m + C_{substrate})}, (18)

<a id='3ec48f21-d622-4786-9774-b0c9b364f11c'></a>

where RNO is the initial rate, RNO,max is the maximum NO production rate of the enzyme determined by Eq. (17), CSubstrate is the concentration of different substrates, and Km is the Michaelis constant for eNOS for the substrate. Figs. 6A and B show the NO production as a function of changes in the ambient O2 and accessible L-arginine, respectively, when [eNOS] was 0.045 µM. The Km for O2 was 7.7 µM. Three possible values of apparent Km for L-arginine were tested, ranging from 0.9 and 2.9 µM (Table 1). The NO production, with sufficient quantities of substrate present, was ~55 × 10³ µM/s, which is in the range obtained by the kinetic model.

<a id='82a30564-0558-4492-b05d-7a0ff1040133'></a>

Fig. 6C shows the possible NO production rates when the levels of both ambient O2 and accessible L-arginine are varied: with both O2 and L-arginine being low or high, or one high and the other low. The rates obtained were consistent with the results from the full kinetic model shown in Figs. 2 and 4.

_Comparison with previous measurements and models_

Some previous reports of NO production were summarized in Table 3; our analytic methodology differs from those in previous reports in that we explicitly considered the biochemical pathway of NO synthesis in the endothelium and the availability of the enzyme and substrates.

<a id='92184c73-57fc-429f-9e9f-e7c9e338cbab'></a>

Arnal et al. [14] measured the release of nitrogen oxides (nitrite plus nitrate) from cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. From their experiments, the basal NO production was calculated to be 0.035 µM/s, a result that is close to our prediction. The value reported by Hood et al. [15] was 0.417 µM/s for HUVECs stimulated in vitro by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Kuchan and Frangos [16] measured the release of NO (corresponding to nitrogen oxides) from cultured HUVECs: in the absence of a shear stress stimulus, the rate of nitrogen oxides release was ~0.208 µM/s, and it increased to ~10.4 µM/s when a shear stress of 6 dyn/cm² was applied. However, these measurements could be complicated by the fact that other isoforms of NOS may be expressed in cultured ECs. De Assis et al. [48] found that iNOS was expressed and functionally active in cultured HUVECs as a result of adaptive responses. Moreover, they reported that the expression of iNOS in cultured HUVECs was significantly high, comparable to the level in macrophages. Thus, the NO measured in vitro may not have been derived solely from eNOS.

endothelial thickness of 1–4 µm, we estimated that the NO
production in their experiments was ~3–12 µM/s. Vaughn et al.
[7] have analyzed the experimental measurements of NO
concentration by Malinski et al. [8] using a mathematical model
and estimated the rate of NO production to be 6.8 × 10⁻¹⁴ µmol
µm⁻² s⁻¹. If we assume the thickness of the endothelium to be

1 µm, an NO release rate of 68 µM/s can be obtained from
dividing the above rate by the thickness, yielding a value that is
about three orders of magnitude higher than those shown in Fig.
2. However, the nNOS expressed in abundant nerve fibers and
mast cells that are adjacent to the blood vessels [49] could have
significantly contributed to the NO concentration measured in
the in vivo experiments.

_Possible explanations for the apparent discrepancy in NO production rates_

<a id='7bda2b3a-3230-47b5-b344-d4254593abc7'></a>

To summarize the above analyses, the model (1) correctly predicts the K_m values of eNOS for L-arginine and O2, consistent with experimental values; (2) it correctly predicts the linear dependence of NO production on eNOS availability, consistent with enzyme theory; and (3) the resulting catalytic rate is close to the apparent turnover rate of eNOS as measured experimentally. Possible sources for the discrepancy in NO production rates between our predictions and some of the reported values include:

<a id='a9a643ee-9356-4af8-8141-f5b4a571bb2d'></a>

1. The mechanism of the model. The five-electron transfer mechanism for NOS-mediated catalysis of NO synthesis has been established [24,27]. Moreover, as discussed above, the model based on this mechanism correctly predicts several properties of eNOS. To account for a discrepancy of several orders of magnitude, a large part of the known mechanism would need to be revised, although this scenario seems unlikely.
2. Kinetic parameters. We explored the sensitivity of NO production to the kinetic parameters (supplemental materials, Table S1). This sensitivity analysis showed that the heme reduction rate was the sensitive parameter for NO production. However, Fig. 4 shows that changes in only the heme

reduction rate cannot account for the orders of magnitude difference in the NO production rates. Apart from the heme reduction rate, RNO is insensitive to the changes in other parameters. For example, when only one parameter is varied, RNO varies only within a small range (<10% even with a 100-fold change in most kinetic parameters). Only coordinated changes in multiple parameters could significantly increase RNO. However, most of the parameters have been measured by multiple groups in vitro, and it is unlikely that those results contain significant systematic errors. Another possibility was that the maximal activity of eNOS in intact cells could be higher than reported for the isolated enzyme. The posttranslational modifications or protein-protein interactions in the cell may have an important effect on regulatory control of NO generation.

3. Measurement of the substrates and eNOS level. An assessment of the sensitivities of NO production to various substrates showed that NO production rate was insensitive to increases in both L-arginine and O2 when their concentrations were relatively high (Fig. 3). Under these conditions, an increase in the availability of the substrates did not significantly change NO production. However, the NO production was linearly dependent on the intracellular concentration of eNOS. As a result, a higher expression of eNOS could significantly increase NO production. The intracellular concentration of eNOS that we used was an average estimated from a large number (105 or 106) of ECs. However, the distribution of eNOS may be heterogeneous in different tissues or among ECs from different vessels. Thus, detailed measurements of eNOS distribution among different hierarchies of vasculature would be useful for providing a better understanding of NO production in different tissues.

_The amount of NO that is required to maintain vascular tone_

The amount of NO that is capable of activating 50% sGC has been investigated. According to Stone and Marletta [50], at least 250 nM NO is required to stimulate half-maximal activity of sGC at 10  C. Condorelli and George [51], using a mathematical model, estimated that 23 nM NO can activate 50% sGC. Other reports have shown that activation of sGC requires only 1–5 nM NO in the smooth muscle region [52].

Kavdia and Popel [11] have used a computational model to predict the NO concentration in smooth muscle region around an arteriole with radius of 25 µm, based on the NO production rate previously estimated [7]. We used the predicted rate from our model to investigate how much NO can reach the smooth muscle region. The geometry of the model describing NO transport and the kinetic parameters were the same as in [11]. For solving the differential equations describing NO transport, we used the FlexPDE software package (PEDSolutions, Antioch, CA), as previously described [11]. In brief, the model consisted of the lumen, endothelium, smooth muscle, and parenchymal cells. We used 16, 84, and 97 × 10⁻³ µM/s as NO production rates, corresponding to the cases in which the heme reduction rates were 0.84, 8.16, and 18.0 s⁻¹, respectively (Fig. 4). Only eNOS-derived NO was considered. The calculation

<a id='688e0b48-e3a7-4402-a15e-92952fa28af2'></a>

could also be conducted by scaling down the prediction in [11],
using the production rate predicted in the present study, since
the NO concentration is essentially a linear function of the
production rate. Our calculation showed that the predicted NO
concentration in the area of the smooth muscle was only 20–
100 pM, orders of magnitude lower than that predicted by
previous models using a high NO production rate ([11,53]) and
measured in a number of perivascular NO measurements
[41,42,54,55]. This value is also below the lowest required NO
concentration for half-maximal sGC activity that has been
estimated [50–52], but might still be able to trigger maximal
vascular relaxation through the mechanism which does not
require the full potential of cGMP accumulation achievable by
full cyclase activation, as suggested in the study by Kollau et al.
[56].

NO sources in addition to eNOS

These previously noted estimates of NO derived only from eNOS appear to be inconsistent with experimental evidence of vasodilation. However, when the NO derived from nNOS is also considered, more NO is available to reach the smooth muscle. Huang et al. [57] measured the vascular tone of isolated coronary arteries in eNOS knockout mice suffused with a physiological salt solution. In their experiments, they found that nNOS-derived NO and prostaglandins maintain flow-induced vasodilation. Their immunohistochemical measurements also showed the presence of nNOS in vascular tissue from mice and, moreover, in the endothelium of the coronary arteries from eNOS knockout mice. Given the predictions from our model and the fact that relatively abundant nNOS expression around arterioles has been reported in other studies [49,57,58], it is likely that nNOS (and possibly iNOS) plays an important role in maintaining vasodilation. This conclusion is also corroborated by theoretical models [11,53]. Moreover, it has been reported that NO can be produced in the mitochondria, possibly by mitochondrial nitric oxide synthase (mtNOS) [59].

<a id='1b69027e-6ba2-4577-a06d-03625a03c0cb'></a>

Nonenzymatic NO production could also be a significant NO source under certain conditions. S-Nitrosyl hemoglobin has been suggested to serve as a storage pool for NO, and NO can be released when a reduction in _p_O2 is sensed [60]. Another possibility is that NO is stored in the form of circulating nitrite, which can be reduced by a reductase, such as deoxygenated hemoglobin, to release NO especially in precapillary arterioles [61].

<a id='773f18b3-b8a2-426c-bdb2-c2185f9965d2'></a>

eNOS has been thought to be the major NO-producing source for maintaining vascular tone, and eNOS knockout experiments in vivo have shown evidence of increased vascular tone or hypertension [62]. These results seem contradictory to the predictions of our model if the required EC50 of NO for sGC is higher than ~100 pM. However, the apparent discrepancy could be explained by experimental findings that have demonstrated the presence of nNOS in the vasculature and adjacent cells (e.g., neurons, mast cells) and documented its contribution to vasodilation [49,57]. The present analysis also raises a question about how to explain the shear stress-dependent NO production that is commonly ascribed to eNOS. This question has been discussed by Kashiwagi et al.

## Conclusions

The predictions of the present model appear to be paradoxical: based on the catalytic mechanism and the experimentally reported expression of eNOS, NO derived from eNOS in the endothelium cannot account for the perivascular NO concentration reported in a number of previous studies [41,42,54,55]. The large discrepancy is possibly related to the existence of NO sources other than eNOS, either enzymatic or nonenzymatic, or a higher abundance of eNOS in the endothelium of some tissues. Further real-time NO measurements with high specificity for particular NO sources are needed to provide a clearer understanding of the process of NO release. The discrepancy could also potentially be explained by the possibility that NO production by eNOS is species and/or condition dependent. In addition, in the present study we used our model to test the sensitivity of NO production to substrate availability, eNOS concentration, and potential rate-limiting factors. The results showed that the low NO production can primarily be attributed to the low expression of eNOS in the endothelial cells in the microvasculature.

This study provides a basis for more detailed computational
in silico studies of NO production from the endothelium under
physiological conditions, and it identifies important parameters
and factors that should be examined experimentally. The model
can be extended to include the effects of various stimuli on the
endothelium under physiological and pathological conditions.
