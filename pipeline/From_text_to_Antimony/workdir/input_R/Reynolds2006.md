Abstract

The acute inflammatory response, triggered by a variety of biological or physical stresses on an organism, is a delicate system of checks and balances that, although aimed at promoting healing and restoring homeostasis, can result in undesired and occasionally lethal physiological responses. In this work, we derive a reduced conceptual model for the acute inflammatory response to infection, built up from consideration of direct interactions of fundamental effectors. We harness this model to explore the importance of dynamic anti-inflammation in promoting resolution of infection and homeostasis. Further, we offer a clinical correlation between model predictions and potential therapeutic interventions based on modulation of immunity by anti-inflammatory agents.

## 1. Introduction
Acute biological stress, such as severe infection or trauma, leads to the development of an acute inflammatory response. The goal of this response is to promote adaptation of the organism to stress, eliminate threats to survival such as pathogens, and promote tissue repair and healing. However, an excessive or inappropriate inflam- matory response will lead to collateral tissue damage, organ dysfunction, a prolonged healing phase, or possibly death. This state of excessive inflammation is particularly common in association with extensive physiological organ support as provided in modern intensive care units (Goris et al., 1985; Takala et al., 1999). Organisms have developed regulatory mechanisms to contain the molecular and cellular cascades initiated by excessive inflammation. In general, pro-inflammatory elements that are key to ridding

organisms of large numbers of pathogens also mobilize a
negative feedback, or anti-inflammatory response, which
downregulates the initial inflammatory wave (Fig. 1).
Specific details of pro- and anti-inflammatory responses
may be sculpted by the nature and magnitude of the
initiating insults, as well as by genetic predispositions.

In prior work, we constructed a reduced mathematical
model of the pro-inflammatory response (Kumar et al., 2004)
consisting of a response instigator (pathogen) and early and
late pro-inflammatory mediators. While that model captured
a variety of clinically relevant scenarios associated with the
inflammatory response to infection, the goal of the present
work is to gain insight into the presumed advantage and
robustness instilled by the presence of a time-dependent anti-
inflammatory response. While anti-inflammation inhibits the
subsequent build-up of pro-inflammation and the damage to
tissue that may be caused by pro-inflammation, it also
mitigates the subsequent production of anti-inflammatory
mediators. Thus, the overall effects of anti-inflammation on
the outcome following pathogenic infection, and how these

<::flowchart: A diagram illustrating the interactions within a four-variable model of the acute immune response. The diagram features four main components: 'Initiating event (P)', 'Inflammation (N*)', 'Damage (D)', and 'Anti-inflammation (C_A)'. 'Inflammation' is represented by a flame icon, and 'Anti-inflammation' by a snowflake icon. Arrows indicate upregulation or stimulation, and bars (T-shaped lines) indicate inhibition. Specific interactions are as follows: Initiating event (P) upregulates Inflammation (N*) and inhibits Anti-inflammation (C_A). Inflammation (N*) upregulates Damage (D) and Anti-inflammation (C_A). Damage (D) upregulates Inflammation (N*) and inhibits Anti-inflammation (C_A). Anti-inflammation (C_A) inhibits Inflammation (N*). There is also a self-inhibitory loop for Inflammation (N*) and a direct inhibitory connection from Anti-inflammation (C_A) to Inflammation (N*). The bar between anti-inflammation and inflammation corresponds to the inhibition of both the production of inflammation and the ability of inflammation to interact with all other involved species.

effects depend on parameters such as pathogen growth rate
and the anti-inflammatory response rate itself, may be
difficult to predict by intuition alone but are well suited for
dynamical systems analysis.

<a id='55862bab-b8e3-4cc9-a0e9-5f133cdf4405'></a>

As the first step in performing this mathematical analysis, we derive a reduced model of the acute immune response that incorporates pro- and anti-inflammation. This model does not include components of the adaptive immune response, such as T-cells and specific antibodies. Therefore, this model describes the generic response to pathogenic insult (Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002). Our derivation proceeds through several stages, based on calibration of subsystems to generally accepted features of the interactions of particular immune system components, as observed in previous experimental studies. We construct a reduced model of inflammation from these subsystems, where the impact of dynamic anti-inflammation is evaluated through simulations and bifurcation studies. Our results illustrate the health advantage conferred by a dynamic anti-inflammatory response and suggest that the rates of this response may be well tuned to yield optimal outcomes following pathogenic infection. Our findings also point to risks associated with manipulation of the levels of the anti-inflammatory mediator present, either before an initial infection or following an initial infection that is on its way to, but has not yet reached, a healthy resolution. We conclude with a discussion in which we elaborate on these and other possible therapeutic implications of our results.

## 2. Methods

Our reduced model of the acute inflammatory response
consists of a system of four differential equations in which

<a id='dc3eb5e0-bf7e-4f2d-845d-87c817bfe875'></a>

the dependent variables represent the levels of pathogen (P), activated phagocytes (N*) such as activated neutrophils, tissue damage (D), and anti-inflammatory mediators (CA) such as cortisol and interleukin-10. This model describes the interactions depicted in Fig. 1. We develop this model by first considering the two-variable subsystems N*/P and N*/D, treating CA as a parameter, then combining these subsystems to form a three-variable subsystem, and finally incorporating the dynamics of the anti-inflammatory mediator to create the reduced model. We adopted a subsystem approach to ensure that the interactions of the model variables are consistent with biological observations.

<a id='c492a7d1-8a66-41a6-b506-e4f7b10bfa7b'></a>

Baseline parameter values for both the subsystems and the reduced model are provided in Table 1 and are selected to remain within the given ranges and constraints found in the experimental literature. This baseline parameter set is used for all simulations except where noted in the text. Parameters that could not be documented from existing data were estimated such that the subsystems behave in a biologically appropriate manner for plausible levels of the anti-inflammatory mediators. Furthermore, when the pathogenic insult is replaced by endotoxin as an initiating event, as presented in Day et al. (2006), the resulting model qualitatively reproduces the responses of immune mediators measured experimentally during repeated endotoxin administrations. Further details on the derivation of parameter ranges, constraints and estimated values, are presented in the Supplementary Materials. Units for the model variables and many of the associated parameters cannot be determined, since the variables represent various types of cells, signaling proteins such as cytokines, and/or other mediators concurrently. More precisely, these variables quantify the response of the immune function they represent rather than, for example, an exact cell count. Therefore, units of most parameters related to these variables are not in conventional form, but rather in terms of the associated variable.

Throughout the analysis of the reduced model and its
subsystems, we will be tracking the existence and values of
fixed points, determining the parameter regimes in which
particular fixed points are stable, and locating bifurcations.
A fixed point is a point where the derivatives of all
variables in the system are zero, also known as a critical
point or equilibrium point. This occurs where the
nullclines¹ of the system intersect. We will refer to a fixed
point as stable if the real part of each eigenvalue associated
with the linearized system at that fixed point is negative. In
the systems that we consider, it is exactly the stable fixed
points that represent possible asymptotic steady states
attained by open sets of initial conditions. A bifurcation

¹For a system of the form dx/dt = f(x, y); dy/dt = g(x, y), the x-nullcline (y-nullcline) is the set of points in the (x,y) plane that satisfy f=0 (g = 0). Intersections of nullclines are fixed points, since at an intersection both dx/dt and dy/dt are zero. These ideas generalize directly to systems with more than two equations.

occurs when a change in a parameter alters the number of
fixed points and/or their stability, and thus changes the
number and nature of the asymptotic steady states of the
system (Strogatz, 1994).

<a id='fc5a5d60-5555-4ade-a1c8-9aa5875a2d1a'></a>

The reduced model displays three physiologically relevant equilibrium points, which correspond to biological states of health, aseptic death, and septic death, respectively. The health state is a fixed point with P = 0, N* = 0, D = 0, and CA = sc/μc, which, when stable, is the desirable asymptotic behavior. The aseptic death state, which corresponds to an outcome where pathogen has been eliminated but with high and persistent immune activation and damage, is a fixed point where P = 0, N*>0, D>0 and CA>0. The third possible equilibrium is septic death, where all variables are non-zero, which corresponds to a state in which there is insufficient immune activation to clear pathogen. Note that a healthy outcome viewed as a return to an equilibrium point is an idealized construct. In fact, the complex biological systems we are considering are out of equilibrium and a return to mediator levels within the basin of attraction² of the health state is a desirable outcome. However, in the reduced model, solutions with initial conditions in the basin of attraction of health asymptotically approach health. Thus, for simplicity we refer to the fixed point, (0,0,0,sc/μc) as the health state.

2.1. The non-specific local immune response: the M/P subsystem

A normal individual in a healthy state has a baseline capacity to respond and resolve local infections. This resides in the presence of cells, such as tissue macrophages as well as other non-specific physical and biological defenses, such as defensins and non-specific antibodies (Ochsenbein and Zinkernagel, 2000; Paulsen et al., 2002; Raj and Dentino, 2002). This local response is rapid and effective, but can be overwhelmed with large inocula or rapidly dividing pathogens. To account for this non-specific local removal of pathogen, we assume the reactions in Table 2, with the non-specific local response and pathogen levels represented by the variables M and P, respectively.

<a id='faaf641e-3ec2-4720-98b3-289c5494eae6'></a>

From the reactions in Table 2, based on mass action kinetics, we derive the following preliminary equations:

<a id='99684bd6-f759-4e9c-900b-0ca39b975aea'></a>

<a id='f9b2be89-b90a-48e2-abd2-74277fd87d8e'></a>

For simplicity, we assume that the local response reaches
quasi-steady state and substitute M = S_m/(µ_m + k_mpP) into
the pathogen equation. Further, to incorporate the
dynamics of the pathogen population into our model, we

used a logistic growth term, $k_{pg}P(1 - P/p_{\infty})$. Therefore, we obtain the pathogen equation:

$\frac{dP}{dt} = k_{pg}P\left(1 - \frac{P}{p_{\infty}}\right) - \frac{k_{pm}s_mP}{\mu_m + k_{mp}P}.$ (1)

<a id='4a3d2aba-ee3a-41fb-b600-070ab1b52f6e'></a>

Here, the pathogen growth rate and the carrying capacity of the pathogen population are represented by $k_{pg}$ and $p_\infty$, respectively. The units for $k_{pg}$ are per hour while $p_\infty$ has the same units as P, $10^6$/cc. P = 0 is always a fixed point of Eq. (1). We find that a saddle-node bifurcation gives rise to two additional fixed points, say $p_1 < p_2$, which exist for $k_{pg} > 4k_{mp}k_{pm}s_m p_\infty / (p_\infty k_{mp} + \mu_m)^2$, or equivalently for $k_{pg} > 0.059$ with the parameters in [Table 1](Table 1). When they first arise, $p_1$ and $p_2$ are positive. Direct linearization and algebraic manipulation show that P = 0 is stable for $k_{pg} < k_{pm}s_m / \mu_m = 1.5$, where it loses stability in a transcritical bifurcation with $p_1$, and that the largest fixed point is stable whenever it exists. Thus for $0.059 < k_{pg} < 1.5$, this subsystem is bistable.

## 2.2. The N*/P subsystem

A key component of the acute immune response is the removal of the pathogen by phagocytic immune cells, such as activated neutrophils and macrophages. Resting phagocytes are activated by pathogen and by previously activated phagocytes via the binding of endotoxin and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Janeway and Medzhitov, 2002). Once activated, a phagocyte becomes efficient at eliminating pathogens. When the growth rate of the pathogen is low, activated phagocytes are capable of clearing the pathogen in normal individuals. However, if the growth rate is high, then a sufficiently large inoculum of pathogen can induce a persistent infection despite the attack by activated phagocytes. This dependence on kpg and the interaction between resting and activated phagocytes are essential in developing the N*/P subsystem, which consists of the following:

<a id='a3d4edaf-f7f7-41f2-93a8-3f0d0c9aa25e'></a>

dP/dt = k_pg * P * (1 - P/P_infinity) - (k_pm * s_m * P) / (mu_m + k_mp * P) - k_pn * N* * P (2)

<a id='80746ec7-ab49-452f-a93d-1ed98153382c'></a>

$\frac{dN^{*}}{dt} = \frac{s_{nr} R_{1}}{\mu_{nr} + R_{1}} - \mu_{n}N^{*}$, (3)
where $R_{1} = k_{nn}N^{*} + k_{np}P$.

<a id='07fa723c-465a-4d4a-a1b4-768a7572ee0b'></a>

To derive Eqs. (2) and (3) we first take into account the activation of the resting phagocytes ($N_R$). In particular, from the system of reactions given in Table 3, we derive the

<a id='dc4e4d97-3d20-4041-8f15-9a517b31a3e0'></a>

where $R_1 = k_{nn}N^* + k_{np}P$.
When a resting phagocyte encounters an agent capable of activating it, however, the activation process is rapid. Thus, we assume that the variable $N_R$ is in quasi-steady state, reducing the $N_R/N^*$ system to a single equation (3). When this equation is combined with the pathogen equation (1) derived above, and an additional term is included to encode the direct consumption of pathogen by activated phagocytes, we obtain systems (2) and (3).

<a id='d6780a3d-8be2-4593-afd6-2f8f767a410b'></a>

Linearization of Eqs. (2) and (3) about the health fixed point (P,N*) = (0,0) yields real eigenvalues that are negative for kpg <kpmSm/µm and µη > Snrknn/µηr. Since the second of these inequalities holds for the parameters in Table 1, the condition kpg<kpmSm/µm is once again the criterion for the stability of health, as in the M/P subsystem.

<a id='2254af25-d2e8-4bea-b50b-c51404b46ad1'></a>

We provide a further analysis of the fixed points of Eqs. (2) and (3) below, but first, to more accurately model the immune response, we introduce the anti-inflammatory mediator in this subsystem. At this point, we simply encode anti-inflammatory effects in a parameter $C_A$. By treating the anti-inflammatory mediator as a parameter, we can manually manipulate it to verify that sustained variations in its level induce biologically appropriate alterations in the $N^*/P$ dynamics, such that this subsystem will behave appropriately once dynamic anti-inflammatory mediators are incorporated.

<a id='9925ccc2-768b-4e6a-bdfb-ed5a4dfbd863'></a>

In normal individuals, the anti-inflammatory mediator inhibits the activation of phagocytes and reduce the ability of activated phagocytes to attack pathogen (Tsukaguchi et al., 1999). We incorporate this inhibition into the N*/P subsystem by replacing R₁ with f(R₁) and N* with f(N*) in Eq. (2), for f(V) = V/(1 + (C_A/c_∞)²). The parameter c_∞ is set such that when the anti-inflammatory mediators reach their maximum level in response to an infection, their inhibitory effects are roughly equivalent to a 75% reduction in the inhibited element, as seen in Isler et al. (1999). While it would have been reasonable to consider different levels of inhibition by the anti-inflammatory

<a id='00cdd4d0-7289-4c62-a5e3-1fff22c3cdd5'></a>

mediator for each interaction, we consider uniform inhibition for simplicity.

<a id='582b8fc2-d053-438e-a0b4-4af94b92bbd3'></a>

For low pathogen growth rate (kpg), the resulting N*/P subsystem has only the stable health state, whose existence is independent of CA. There is a saddle-node bifurcation at kpg = 0.8829 for the parameters in Table 1 with CA fixed to 0.2. The corresponding bifurcation diagram is displayed in Fig. 2(a), which was created, as were all other figures in this paper, using XPPAUT (Ermentrout, 2002). Of the pair of fixed points born in the saddle-node bifurcation, the lower (with respect to N*) is a saddle separatrix, while the upper, corresponding to septic death (P>0, N*>0), is initially unstable. As kpg increases further, there is a Hopf bifurcation at kpg = 1.187, which stabilizes septic death. Finally, health loses stability through a transcritical bifurcation at kpg = 1.5. The stable branch that is created corresponds to negative levels of pathogen and activated phagocytes and is therefore not included in the bifurcation figure. In summary, for 1.187<kpg<1.5 and CA = 0.2, this subsystem features bistability between health and septic death.

<a id='3c2ec5c3-73a1-45aa-b82e-89c8668816a8'></a>

This bifurcation structure remains qualitatively similar for nearby values of C_A, while for sufficiently elevated C_A levels, septic death is stable as soon as it appears and we no longer observe a Hopf bifurcation. We examined the criteria for existence of stable septic death in a two-parameter bifurcation k_pg-C_A plane. A curve divides the plane in two regions (solid curve in Fig. 2(b)). For parameter values on the left of the curve, stable septic death does not exist, while on the right, it does. Also in Fig. 2(b), at k_pg = 1.5, there is a dashed vertical line that denotes where the health state loses stability. This line further divides the plane, creating a total of four regions: health, health/septic death, septic death, and a shaded region. The first three regions are labeled by the stable states that corresponding parameter values support. In the shaded region, septic death does not exist, and health is unstable. Therefore, there is no stable fixed point and trajectories oscillate. This does not represent a biologically observed state; however, once we combine subsystems below, oscillations will no longer occur.

In Fig. 2(c), we see the effect of C_A on the level of activated phagocytes (N*) in the septic death state when it first becomes stable. From Fig. 2(b), we know that as C_A increases, the k_pg value at which the stable septic death state appears decreases. Biologically, this corresponds to a prediction that holding C_A at a larger constant level

induces a greater inhibition of the immune response,
allowing a less virulent pathogen to induce a septic death
outcome. In theory, this inhibition of N* could allow an
initial enhancement of the build-up of P, which would
subsequently evoke a large rise in N*, leading to a high N*
septic death state; alternatively, the combination of higher
C_A and low k_pg could suppress the level of N* seen in septic
death. Fig. 2(c) shows that in fact the latter possibility
occurs, such that the activated phagocyte levels reached in

For parameters corresponding to the region of septic
death/health in Fig. 2(b), the N*/P subsystem is bistable.

manifold of a saddle fixed point, separates the two stable
states, as we see Fig. 2(d) and (e) for C_A = 0.2. Notice the

of the saddle point divide the P-axis into three regions. Suppose an initial pathogen load, P_0, is introduced to the system, which had previously been in the health state. When P_0 falls in the first region, to the left of the P nullcline, the non-specific local response is able to eliminate the pathogen without any transient pathogen growth. If P_0 falls in the middle region, between the P nullcline and the stable manifold, then the pathogen is able to overcome the local response and initially grow before the activated phagocytes respond and clear the infection. If P_0 is in the final region, to the right of the stable manifold, then the immune response is unable to heal the individual. When the subsystems are combined, and the anti-inflammatory mediator is allowed to evolve dynamically, we shall see that these regions persist, with qualitatively similar properties. Thus, this analysis of the N*/P system with a constant anti-inflammatory mediator is helpful in understanding the role of the activated phagocytes in the pro-inflammatory response to pathogen.

## 2.3. The N*/D subsystem

When activated phagocytes respond to an infection, their presence in the tissue not only kills pathogens, but may also lead to collateral tissue damage (Goris et al., 1985; Takala et al., 1999). Damaged tissue releases pro-inflammatory cytokines, which causes further phagocyte activation. This positive feedback interaction between phagocytes and damage also exists in the absence of pathogen and can be triggered by other stimuli, such as tissue trauma. Therefore, the N*/D system should be bistable between health and aseptic death over a range of the anti-inflammatory mediator. Modeling the interactions between activated phagocytes and damage, we developed the N*/D subsystem, which consists of the following:

<a id='01f28eb5-3908-4750-b91d-d2f011a5448b'></a>

dN*/dt = s_nr R_2 / (μ_nr + R_2) - μ_n N*, (4)

<a id='a7caec1d-d973-48b1-8867-0a319a88a861'></a>

dD/dt = k_dn f_s(N*) - \mu_d D, (5)
where R_2 = k_nn N* + k_nd D and the saturation function is phenomenologically defined as f_s(V) = V^6/(x_dn^6 + V^6).

<a id='a8aabb60-f3c1-49f5-91f0-478b7e4d475b'></a>

As in the N*/P systems (2) and (3), the activated phagocyte equation in the N*/D system is derived by first considering a system of equations that includes the resting phagocytes and subsequently assuming that the resting phagocytes are in quasi-steady state. The only difference between the N* equations (3) and (4) appears in the activation of resting phagocytes, which we now take to be affected by D rather than P. Correspondingly, R1 from Eq. (3) is replaced by R2 = knnN* + kndD in Eq. (4).

<a id='32c675ce-99db-408c-8a8f-ea2fc0f00e42'></a>

At low counts, activated phagocytes do not cause significant damage. However, as they accumulate in response to an infection, the activated phagocytes will cause tissue damage to accrue. Finally, once levels of activated phagocytes are sufficiently high, damage saturates, such that the activation of additional phagocytes has little impact on damage creation. We model this non-linearity in the induction of damage by activated phagocytes via the Hill-type function, f_s, in Eq. (5). The coefficient in f_s must be chosen to be sufficiently large to produce a reasonable basin of attraction for health in the N*/D system (see Supplementary Materials for further explanation). We subtract the term _dD in Eq. (5) to represent tissue repair, resolution, and regeneration. Linear stability analysis of the health state, (N*, D) = (0,0), shows that the eigenvalues are negative for _n > s_nrk_nn/_nr, which is the same condition that arose for the N*/P subsystem and always holds for our baseline parameter set.

<a id='ae07e65b-cd98-453d-a197-f2dc1dad7dfc'></a>

As in the N*/P subsystem, we introduce the anti-
inflammatory mediator (C_A) into the N*/D subsystem as
a parameter to ensure that our other parameter choices
give the desired bistability for all physiological levels of C_A.
As in the previous subsystem, the inclusion of the anti-
inflammatory mediator leads to inhibition of activated
phagocytes by two means. Specifically, the activation
process itself is inhibited, which we model by replacing
R_2 with f(R_2) in Eq. (4), where f is the same saturating
function defined for inhibition in the N*/P subsystem. The
ability of activated phagocytes to cause damage is also
inhibited by the anti-inflammatory mediator, which we
model by replacing N* with f(N*) in Eq. (5).

As in the N*/P subsystem, the nullclines of the modified

Fig. 2. Bifurcation diagrams and nullclines for the N*/P subsystem. (a) Bifurcation diagram generated for C_A = 0.2 with bifurcation parameter k_pg. There is a saddle-node bifurcation at k_pg = 0.8829, Hopf bifurcation at k_pg = 1.187, where the system becomes bistable between septic death and health, and a transcritical bifurcation at k_pg = 1.5, where health loses stability. The stable branch emerging from the transcritical point corresponds to negative pathogen and activated phagocytes, a non-physiological situation not displayed. The number of bold curves a vertical line intersects corresponds to the number of stable outcomes possible for the parameter value represented by this line. Which asymptotic outcome is reached depends on the initial conditions of the system. For example, a vertical line at k_pg = 1.3 would intersect two bold curves; therefore, at this parameter value there are two stable outcomes, health and septic death. (b) Two-parameter bifurcation diagram. We follow the existence of stable septic death (the bold line) and the transcritical (dashed line) from (a), with C_A as the second parameter. This divides the k_pg-C_A plane into regions labeled by the set of stable outcomes that exist. In the shaded region there are no stable fixed points and the system oscillates. The diamond represents the point where the bifurcation giving rise to stable septic death changes from a Hopf (below the diamond) to a saddle-node bifurcation (above the diamond). (c) Plot of the solid curve from (b) in (N*, k_pg) space shows the level of activated phagocytes reached at the onset of stable septic death as a function of k_pg.

values of C_A. Similar to Fig. 2(d) and (e), Fig. 3(a) shows the nullclines and invariant sets of the N*/D subsystem with C_A = 0.2. The stable manifold of the saddle point defines the threshold between health and aseptic death. The parameters and the Hill coefficient are chosen so that this threshold allows activated phagocytes to adequately respond to an inoculum of pathogen without triggering aseptic death.

In the bifurcation diagram for the anti-inflammatory
mediator in Fig. 3(b), we see that the N*/D subsystem
displays bistability between health and aseptic death for
C_A<0.626. Note that as the level of C_A increases, the level

<a id='664beb42-57a2-4b55-8c11-369c52d840a1'></a>

of activated phagocytes reached at aseptic death is decreased. This trend makes sense, since the anti-inflam- matory mediator inhibits the activation of phagocytes. Eventually, this inhibition prevents the system from equilibrating at a state where N* remains elevated; specifically, as C_A increases, the nullclines pull apart and eventually do not intersect. This occurs at the saddle node C_A = 0.626 and causes this subsystem to lose bistability. We note that this value lies above the physiological relevant range for C_A and also is consistent with the intuition that high C_A levels prevent the explosion of N* needed for aseptic death.

2.4. The three-variable subsystem

We combine the above two systems by including effects of both pathogen and damage on the rate at which the resting phagocytes are activated. To do this, we let R3 = knnN* + knpP + kndD and again assume that the resting phagocytes are in quasi-steady state to obtain the system of equations:

<a id='2ea21235-fb8e-4a48-a759-2e0ba034a350'></a>

dP/dt = k_pg P (1 - P/P_∞) - k_pm s_m P / (μ_m + k_mp P) - k_pn N* P, (6)

dN*/dt = s_nr R_3 / (μ_nr + R_3) - μ_n N*, (7)

dD/dt = k_dn f_s(N*) - μ_d D, (8)
where
R_3 = k_nn N* + k_np P + k_nd D
and
f_s(V) = V^6 / (x_dn^6 + V^6)

<a id='e7163b7e-41a8-476c-b0ad-8e4e917f3800'></a>

Models (6)-(8) exhibit the combined dynamics of the previous two subsystems. The conditions for stable health are unchanged from the N*/P subsystem, since D = 0 at the health fixed point. In particular, health is stable for low pathogen growth rate (kpg), but loses stability at a transcritical bifurcation at kpg = 1.5 as kpg is increased. Since this instability is induced by the pathogen dynamics, it follows that even after this stability loss, the healthy state retains a two-dimensional stable manifold, such that small perturbations in the non-pathogen components lead to healthy resolutions. For low or moderate growth rate, the system inherits the existence of stable aseptic death from the bistability of the N*/D subsystem. Consequently, for low pathogen growth rate, the physiological outcomes after pathogenic infection are health, achieved when the initial pathogen level is low, and aseptic death, arising when the initial inoculum of pathogen is large enough that the resulting phagocytic response results in large tissue damage.

<a id='22b4ac59-0514-446d-ac1b-54b54f60901a'></a>

As in the N*/P subsystem, increasing pathogen growth rate leads to a bifurcation that introduces the possibility of septic death. Fig. 4(a) shows a bifurcation diagram with C_A = 0.2, in which we see that this bifurcation is a Hopf at k_pg = 1.707. This diagram also shows the transcritical bifurcation that destabilizes the health state at k_pg = 1.5; the second branch of equilibria participating in this bifurcation is not shown, since it corresponds to a non-physiological state with negative pathogen and activated phagocytes. Since health is already unstable for k_pg < 1.707, there are only two possible stable outcomes, aseptic death and septic death, until k_pg = 2.769, when aseptic death loses stability through a second transcritical bifurcation. Aseptic death loses stability when k_pg becomes so large that

<a id='357c4005-ef46-44a5-b4ce-c32913c9f65d'></a>

the immune system cannot clear the pathogen, preventing
stability of a state with a non-zero pathogen level and
leaving septic death as the only stable state for the system.

Despite the bistability between aseptic and septic death for 1.707 < k_pg < 2.769, initial conditions with only pathogen elevated, and all other variables at healthy levels, always lead to septic death for fixed C_A. The aseptic death outcome is attainable if tissue trauma (D_0 > 0) occurs in the absence of pathogen or if the initial level of activated phagocytes (N*_0 > 0) is elevated (with or without pathogen). A pre-activated immune system allows the infection to be cleared, avoiding septic death. However, activated phagocytes continue to be elevated in response to the pathogen, and this triggers aseptic death.

Next, we follow the bifurcation points in a two-parameter bifurcation diagram in the $k_{pg}-C_A$ plane (Fig. 4(a) and (b)). The existence of septic death is represented by the solid curve. For a combination of parameters on the right of this curve, this system enters septic death (given a sufficient inocula for pathogen), while on the left, septic death does not exist. The transcritical bifurcation where health loses stability is represented by the vertical dashed line at $k_{pg} = 1.5$. To the right of this line the health state is unstable. The transcritical threshold corresponding to the loss of stability of aseptic death is represented by a blue dashed curve. Also, for $C_A$ levels above the horizontal, dashed line, aseptic death does not exist due to the same saddle-node bifurcation we showed in the $N^*/D$ subsystem. Therefore, aseptic death is not a possible outcome above the horizontal, dashed line or to the right of the blue dashed curve. Combining these bifurcation structures we are able to label each region, as we did in Fig. 2(b), by the stable states they support.

<a id='74ed1571-b068-4b75-baa0-13ccdfb78cee'></a>

From the two-parameter bifurcation diagram in Fig. 4(b), we observe that for C_A>0.234, the bifurcation giving rise to the existence of septic death occurs at a k_pg <1.5. Therefore, if 0.234<C_A<0.626 (indicated by the horizontal, dashed line in Fig. 4(b)), there is a range of k_pg for which all three outcomes are stable. As in the case with C_A = 0.2 and bistability between aseptic and septic death, the path to aseptic death is sensitive to initial conditions and there is a propensity to enter septic death when only pathogen is initially introduced.

2.5. The four-variable model

We complete the model derivation by introducing time dependence to the anti-inflammatory mediator C_A, thereby obtaining our four-variable reduced model of the acute immune response. The production of the anti-inflammatory mediator is associated with the presence of activated phagocytes (de Waal et al., 1991) and elevated markers of tissue damage (Stvrtinova et al., 1995). As discussed in the development of the various subsystems considered above, the anti-inflammatory mediator (C_A) regulates the immune response by inhibiting the production and effects of activated phagocytes and damage. More specifically, the

Fig. 4. Bifurcation diagrams for the three-variable subsystem. (a) Bifurcation diagram for kpg with CA = 0.2. Health and aseptic death both lose stability through transcritical bifurcations, at kpg = 1.5 and 2.769, respectively. The emerging stable states correspond to non-physiological states and are not shown. At kpg = 1.702 there is a saddle-node bifurcation giving rise to two additional fixed points that are both initially unstable. However, at kpg = 1.707, a Hopf bifurcation creates a stable state, which corresponds to septic death. Therefore, when kpg <1.5, there is bistability between health and aseptic death; for 1.5<kpg<1.707, aseptic death is the only stable state; there is bistability between aseptic and septic death for 1.707<kpg<2.769; and septic death is the only stable state for kpg>2.769. (b) Two-parameter bifurcation diagram generated by following the Hopf, saddle node, and transcritical bifurcations from (a). The black solid curve represents the onset of stable septic death. The diamond again represents the switch from a Hopf (below) to a saddle node (above) bifurcation. Each region is labeled by the possible stable outcomes in the corresponding parameter regime. Transcritical bifurcations are represented by dashed curves; the vertical is the loss of stable health and the blue the loss of stable aseptic death. The red, dashed, horizontal line corresponds to where the aseptic death state loses existence due to a saddle-node bifurcation as CA is increased, which is related to the saddle point seen in Fig. 3(b) from the N*/D subsystem.

presence of C_A decreases the ability of activated phagocytes to react to other cell types, reducing their effectiveness against the pathogen, their induction of damage, and their production of additional C_A (de Waal et al., 1991). The recruitment of C_A by tissue damage (D) is similarly

N*/(1+(CA/C)²) in Eqs. (6) and (8). The inhibition of the activation of resting phagocytes is modeled by replacing R3 with R = f(R3) = f(knnN* + knpP+kndD).
Note that f limits to zero as CA approaches infinity, and therefore if CA levels are manipulated to be sufficiently high (above the maximum reached in response to an infection), then they will correspond to nearly complete inhibition of immune activation, which is experimentally observed (D'Andrea et al., 1993).

<a id='10308b80-ee5d-4b28-926c-a4a324ab384a'></a>

The C_A equation contains a source of C_A, denoted s_c,
and a term modeling the production of anti-inflammatory
mediator from damage and activated phagocytes, which
takes the form k_cn(N* + k_cndD)/(1 + N* + k_cndD), before
inhibition is incorporated. This expression is a Michae-
lis–Menten-type term, in which k_cnd controls the effective-
ness of damage, relative to activated phagocytes, in
producing C_A. Including inhibition in this term, we obtain
k_cnf(N*+k_cndD)/(1+f(N* + k_cndD)).

## 3. Results

The reduced model, Eqs. (9)–(12), exhibits the same physiological fixed points as discussed above for the three- variable model. The health state is a fixed point with P = 0, N* = 0, D = 0, and CA = sc/μc. The anti-inflammatory mediator is non-zero in this state, corresponding to the background level of these cytokines that exists in healthy individuals. In aseptic death, P = 0, but N*, D, and CA are non-zero. All variables are non-zero in septic death. Model dynamics for initial conditions leading to health, or aseptic

and septic death are depicted in Fig. 5(a), (b), and (c),
respectively. The qualitative dependence of the existence of
stable states on the pathogen growth rate kpg is maintained
as in the three-variable model. As kpg is increased, the
septic death state comes into existence via a Saddle-node
bifurcation at kpg = 0.5137 and the aseptic death state loses
stability at kpg = 1.755, as can be seen in the bifurcation
graph presented in Fig. 6. As in the subsystems, health
loses stability at a transcritical bifurcation at kpg = 1.5. The
second branch of equilibria involved in this transcritical
bifurcation corresponds to a non-physiological state and is
not included in Fig. 6.

Utilizing both the three-variable subsystem, with the anti-inflammatory mediator treated as a parameter, and the reduced model, we explore several aspects of the role of C$_A$: (1) we investigate the effects of allowing C$_A$ to dynamically depend on other model variables, which we compare to results found by holding the anti-inflammatory response at various constant levels, (2) we vary parameters that govern the speed of the anti-inflammatory response, (3) we analyse the effects resulting from the presence of initially elevated or depleted C$_A$ levels when an infection is introduced, and (4) we consider the effects of reducing or elevating (resetting) C$_A$ after an infection has progressed for multiple hours and then allowing the full model to evolve, a manipulation that simulates a therapeutic intervention with an anti-inflammatory mediator.

<a id='4fd91f6c-7c0a-4b10-9f37-d4e8e992965a'></a>

We first ask whether the dynamics of the anti-inflam-
matory response are important, or whether a similar
protection against runaway inflammation is achieved by
the inclusion of a constant presence of the anti-inflamma-
tory mediator in the model. In Fig. 7, we compare the

The graph shows a horizontal black line around N* = 0.65, and a curve that starts around (0.5, 0.8), goes up to a peak, then turns back and merges with the horizontal line. Key points are marked: a "Saddle-node (k_pg = 0.5137)" with a blue dot around (0.5137, 0.83), and two "Transcritical" points with red dots on the horizontal line at (k_pg = 1.5) and (k_pg = 1.755).

Health and aseptic death lose stability by transcritical bifurcations at k_pg = 1.5 and 1.755, respectively. As in the subsystems, the emerging stable states are not shown, since they are non-physiological. For k_pg<0.5137, the model is bistable between health and aseptic death. The model has all three states stable for 0.5137<k_pg<1.5. There is bistability between aseptic and septic death for 1.5<k_pg<1.755. Finally, above k_pg = 1.755, the only stable state is septic death.::>

<::chart: The chart shows Initial Pathogen (P_0) on the y-axis ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, and Growth Rate of Pathogen (k_pg) on the x-axis ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. Several curves are plotted, representing different C_A levels: a red solid line labeled "Dynamic" with black dots, a blue solid line labeled "C_A = 0.4" with black dots, a green solid line labeled "C_A = 0.3" with black dots, a black solid line labeled "C_A = 0.7" which has a dotted portion at higher k_pg values, a red dashed line labeled "C_A = 0.125", and a black dashed line labeled "C_A = 0". The curves generally decrease as k_pg increases. Fig. 7. The basin of attraction for the health state depends on C_A. For each constant C_A level shown, the three-variable subsystem was used to determine the level of initial pathogen (P_0) that is the threshold between health and death (aseptic or septic), over a range of k_pg. Using the reduced model, with initial conditions N* = 0, D = 0, and C_A = 0.125 and with dynamic C_A, the same was done, giving rise to the curve labeled "Dynamic". The dotted portion of the C_A = 0.7 curve (black) represents a range of k_pg where health is the only stable outcome.::>

<a id='96163c2b-b8ae-43a5-874e-1876eddd5cdf'></a>

outcomes associated with a dynamic C_A response with those found with a variety of constant levels of C_A. At different k_pg values, we determine the level of initial pathogen that is the threshold between health and death (aseptic or septic). The curve associated with C_A = 0 lies below all other curves; the presence of the anti-inflamma- tory mediator, whether dynamic or constant, allows a larger initial pathogen load or growth rate to be tolerated over all physiological (>0) values of the pathogen growth rate, k_pg. An interesting result arising from simulation of the reduced model is that a dynamic anti-inflammatory mediator is almost always more effective than constant levels of the anti-inflammatory mediator at producing a healthy outcome following infection. Indeed, the curve associated with dynamic C_A in Fig. 7 is above all other curves for most k_pg levels. The only exception is that at low growth rate (k_pg <0.307), the curve for C_A = 0.7 (very high C_A) ends and is continued by a dotted line, which crosses above the curve for dynamic C_A. In this region, with C_A=0.7, the only outcome is health, and hence the threshold between health and death is no longer defined. For infections of such low virulence, even large anti- inflammatory levels will not thwart inflammation to a degree that allows runaway infection and death. Tele- ologically, our model demonstrates that a dynamic anti- inflammatory response increases the robustness of the immune response to infection, allowing the body to recover over a broad range of pathogen growth rate, yet in a way that minimizes life-threatening tissue damage.

<a id='df88e3ee-6eae-4a78-915a-80a5fcfdb1cf'></a>

Given that a dynamic anti-inflammatory response is
advantageous, we now consider how the rate of this
response affects the overall outcome following infection.

<a id='928a4f6a-6ae7-44cb-b260-425ed912a7bf'></a>

Considering a trajectory that is in the basin of attraction of health but close to the threshold between health and death, we altered the time-scale of C_A by modifying the rate constants reflecting the production (k_cn) and decay rate (μ_c) of the anti-inflammatory mediator simultaneously. A slight increase in these rates helped the system to restore health sooner, but larger increases favored septic death. On the other hand, slowing down the anti-inflammatory dynamics causes the trajectory to proceed to aseptic death. Similar results are obtained over a broad range of pathogen growth rates.

<a id='7492be16-e26c-420b-8f8c-988ce07b86ea'></a>

Next, we use the reduced model to explore the impact of baseline anti-inflammatory mediator levels on response to infection. First, we vary the initial level of $C_A$ ($C_{A0}$) for a given initial level of pathogen ($P_0$) and determine the threshold between health and death at this $P_0$. This was repeated for multiple values of $P_0$ at fixed $k_{pg}$ values. As depicted in Fig. 8, this process defines, for each $k_{pg}$ value, a boundary between health and death illustrated by the corresponding curve. Because the local non-specific immune response in our model is not inhibited by $C_A$, the threshold between health and death cannot fall below the level of pathogen that the local response is capable of clearing, regardless of the initial levels $C_A$. Thus, a vertical asymptote, close to the $k_{pg}$ = 1 curve, is reached for large $k_{pg}$. The dotted line in Fig. 8 indicates the level of $C_{A0}$ found in the healthy state (background), call it $C_{A0}^*$. From Fig. 8, we see that the effect of $C_{A0}$ is generally stronger at lower $k_{pg}$. For such $k_{pg}$, a reduction in $C_{A0}$ from $C_{A0}^*$ moves the threshold for death to lower $P_0$. Conversely, increasing $C_{A0}$ allows the system to handle higher $P_0$. However, the changes that occur for higher $k_{pg}$, while milder, are opposite to these. Moreover, even for low $k_{pg}$, the

The x-axis is labeled "Initial Pathogen (P₀)" and ranges from 0.0 to 2.0. The y-axis is labeled "Initial Anti-Inflammatory Mediator (C_A₀)" and ranges from 0.0 to 0.8. Six colored curves are plotted, each representing a different k_pg value: black for k_pg=1, purple for k_pg=0.6, red for k_pg=0.5, blue for k_pg=0.4, green for k_pg=0.3, and black again for k_pg=0.2.

threshold for death shifts back to lower P₀ when C_A0 is
made sufficiently large. Indeed, it appears that the back-
ground C_A level, C*_{A0}, is fairly optimally situated to allow
for maximal or near-maximal threshold P₀ for a fairly
broad range of high pathogen growth rates values, without
undue compromise of protection at lower k_pg. Interestingly,
however, this background level is not globally optimal.

<a id='f7f8e743-9ab8-4afc-ab2e-1957ac3bf31d'></a>

For solutions to the reduced model with initial condi-
tions in the basin of attraction of the health state, C_A
returns to baseline significantly later than all other
variables (Fig. 5(a)). Therefore, after an infection is
cleared, there is a period of time when only C_A is elevated,
a window of relative immune suppression. Fig. 8 allows us
to consider the effects of introducing a second infection
during this window. Although for high k_pg, the baseline
level of C_A leads to a larger basin of attraction for health
than does elevated C_A, the elevated levels of C_A found
immediately after an infection are only mildly detrimental.
At these levels, C_A offers significant protection against a
subsequent infection of a low or moderate k_pg (see also Day
et al., 2006).

Multiple clinical trials have been conducted in which an anti-inflammatory mediator is administered as treatment to individuals with severe clinical sepsis (i.e. typically a highly inflamed state), where death is a frequent outcome (Annane, 2001; Marshall, 2000). To mimic treatment aimed at modulating the anti-inflammatory mediator after an initial infection, we devised an in silico experiment where an initial pathogen is injected into the reduced model, Eqs. (9)-(12). The infection is allowed to evolve for several hours at which point we instantly decrease or increase the level of C_A, to simulate a therapeutic intervention aimed at depleting or raising the availability of C_A. The simulation then proceeds according to Eqs. (9)-(12). Initially, we ran simulations where the intervention was performed at 8, 10, and 12h after pathogen injection. The results depicted in Fig. 9, obtained for the 10-h intervention, are representative of the case with moderate pathogen growth rate, where the simulation still results in health restoration, yet the solution lies near the threshold between health and aseptic death. In Fig. 9, a sufficiently small depletion of C_A (e.g. C_A = 0.24) still yields a healthy outcome, but resolution to health takes longer. More substantial depletion of C_A (e.g. C_A = 0-0.2) pushes the system to aseptic death; activated phagocytes clear the infection successfully yet are insufficiently inhibited, such that persistent collateral tissue damage results. If instead C_A values are instantly raised beyond 0.35, the simulation leads to septic death due to an excessive inhibition of activated phagocytes, which cannot mount a substantial attack on the pathogen. Therefore, over the time window explored, a modest increase in the anti-inflammatory mediator may indeed be slightly beneficial (e.g. C_A = 0.32 in Fig. 9), but it is important to prevent an overly large increase. This finding could be particularly crucial in clinical circumstances where the body cannot mount a sufficient anti-inflammatory response

<::transcription of the content: chart::>The chart titled "Activated Phagocytes (N*)" on the y-axis versus "Time (Hours)" on the x-axis displays multiple curves representing the levels of activated phagocytes over time under different anti-inflammatory mediator (CA) levels. The y-axis ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, and the x-axis ranges from 0 to 140 hours. There are eight distinct curves shown, some solid and some dashed, each labeled with a CA value or "NORMAL". The caption states that after 10 hours, the anti-inflammatory mediator (CA) is either increased (dashed lines) or decreased (solid lines) without altering pathogen, activated phagocytes, and damage levels. The "NORMAL" curve (black solid line) represents the time course without manipulation of the CA level from its normal level of 0.303. Other curves are labeled by their adjusted CA levels as introduced at 10 hours. The curves are:
- NORMAL (black solid line)
- CA=0.32 (red dashed line, starting around 0.18 at 10h and decreasing to near 0.0 at 140h)
- CA=0 (black solid line, starting around 0.18 at 10h and increasing to around 0.5 at 140h)
- CA=0.12 (red solid line, starting around 0.18 at 10h and increasing to around 0.6 at 140h)
- CA=0.2 (green solid line, starting around 0.18 at 10h and increasing to around 0.48 at 140h)
- CA=0.24 (blue solid line, starting around 0.18 at 10h and decreasing to around 0.05 at 140h)
- CA=0.36 (blue dashed line, starting around 0.18 at 10h and increasing sharply to 1.0 by 70h)
- CA=0.8 (green dashed line, starting around 0.18 at 10h and increasing sharply to 1.0 by 50h)

Fig. 9. Altering the anti-inflammatory mediator levels after an infection has progressed can dramatically alter outcome. In this example, we allow an infection, triggered by an initial pathogen injection of 0.36 with kpg = 0.6/h, to progress for 10 h. After this, the anti-inflammatory mediator (CA) is increased (dashed lines) or decreased (solid lines) without altering pathogen, activated phagocytes, and damage levels. The curve labeled “NORMAL” is the time course obtained without manipulation of the CA level from its normal level of 0.303, and all other curves are labeled by their adjusted CA levels, as introduced at 10 h.<::>

(Annane, 2001; Annane et al., 2002). In such situations, a modest transient increase in anti-inflammation mediator would change the outcome from aseptic death to health, but larger increases would be problematic.

<a id='6d759f3f-ea82-4eca-97fe-885271cbf3cd'></a>

Finally, we explored the sensitivity of these results to pathogen growth rate and timing of intervention. For larger kpg, the thresholds between health, aseptic death, and septic death are quite close together. As we raise kpg from the example in Fig. 9, we find that interventions featuring significant increases in CA continue to promote septic death, while significant decreases favor aseptic death. However, for sufficiently large kpg, aseptic death becomes less of a threat, while there is a propensity for a pathogenic explosion leading to septic death. In these cases, the removal of most or all of the CA present at the time of intervention is optimal for yielding a return to health. We note that if the delay before intervention is increased for moderate kpg, then a greater CA input is needed to avoid aseptic death, since N* builds up during the time before intervention. In cases of high kpg, excessive delays before removal of CA can eliminate their ameliorative effects by prolonging the period of insufficiently restrained pathogen growth. These results highlight further that the outcome of anti-inflammatory therapy will be highly sensitive to the nature of the infection being treated and the details of the therapeutic protocol.

analysis of this model suggest that anti-inflammation plays several important roles in the restoration of health. First, anti-inflammation expands the basin of attraction of health compared to that present in models lacking anti-inflamma- tion (Kumar et al., 2004), which is a desirable feature, given that we expect health to be a robust state. Second, we demonstrate an advantage, in terms of healthy resolution of infection, conferred by the dynamic nature of the anti- inflammatory response, in comparison to a tonic response. This advantage holds in all situations except for the mildest of infections, which, in any case, do not present a vital threat. This is illustrated in current clinical practice, where distressing symptoms associated with mild infections are alleviated by the co-administration of antibiotics and anti- inflammatory mediators. The reduced model also under- lines the importance of the different response rates of substances promoting inflammation, represented in the model by N*, and of the anti-inflammatory mediator that limit this response. Specifically, our results suggest that these rates are fairly well tuned to optimize healthy outcomes to pathogenic infection. Further, we have used simulations of our model to explore how variations in levels of the anti-inflammatory mediator present initially or at some time after initial infection affect the restoration of health following an inflammatory response.

<a id='22b32ba8-d381-454c-b961-3b1d16df2bba'></a>

We followed a systematic, modular approach to model development, building our reduced model from subsystems, each one with biologically plausible dynamics. Indeed, by building up this model through modules, we gain a clear understanding of how each element and interaction in the system contributes to the overall network dynamics. We also ensure that the final model behaves in a way that is consistent with situations in which particular features are absent, such as tissue damage without pathogen exposure, or are experimentally manipulated.

<a id='d54594fa-5140-4477-90a5-3a38c35cb28a'></a>

Our results illustrate the point that administration of an anti-inflammatory mediator during the response to an infection may compromise outcome (Fig. 9). The administration of pharmacological doses of steroids, which are potent natural anti-inflammatory mediators, in severely septic patients, has clearly resulted in worse survival (Schumer, 1976; Sprung et al., 1984). This situation corresponds in our model to either the maintenance of tonic elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory mediator or the transient administration of the anti-inflammatory mediator, in patients who would otherwise survive or evolve to aseptic death, causing septic death (Fig. 9). The association between significant immune suppression and infectious complications is clearly an ongoing concern for several groups of patients. Fortunately, the anti-inflammatory mediator, in addition to being conducive to the healing phase of injury, also plays a role in the acute phase of infection as well. A significant body of recent evidence suggests that low-dose immunosuppression with an anti-inflammatory mediator may in fact improve outcome in patients with severe infection, particularly in patients with an insufficient anti-inflammatory response (Annane, 2001;

<a id='c98458bf-064b-4fb0-962d-f13317d51884'></a>

Annane et al., 2002). Our simulations highlight the dependence of the outcomes of such interventions on pathogen virulence (Fig. 8) and timing of intervention, as discussed in the previous section. Therefore, studies such as those we have performed may be useful for subsequent investigations of anti-inflammatory therapeutic agents. For example, the only approved therapeutic agent for patients with severe sepsis, recombinant human activated Protein C, has anti-inflammatory properties (Bernard et al., 2001; Joyce and Grinnell, 2002; Nick et al., 2004) and the proper degree of modulation with this agent, alone or in combination with others, remains a very active focus of clinical research (Cross and Opal, 2003; Marshall, 2003). How the various features of the inflammatory response interact to govern the outcome following multiple insults, including pathogen, trauma, endotoxin, or other stimuli, also warrants intensive computational exploration (Day et al., 2006).

<a id='3ebeeda8-2e5a-4f19-a145-129e98974338'></a>

The biological relevance of our analysis and conclusions are limited by the significant oversimplification present in our reduced model and the difficulty in translating functions such as "pro-inflammation", "anti-inflamma- tion" and "damage" into measurable quantities. We are also involved with the development of a much larger model that directly addresses this limitation, where predictions are compared to prospectively collected experimental data (Chow et al., 2005). Such large-scale models, however, do not allow for detailed analysis, where emergent behaviors and drivers of such behavior are clearly identified and characterized. Future directions for study include a more detailed biological characterization of anti-inflammatory substances, since they differ widely in the time-scale and specificity of their activity, and a detailed mathematical analysis of the use of anti-inflammatory mediators as "therapeutic" agents, depending on time-scale as well as time and intensity of intervention. The experimental and clinical relevance of these efforts will continue to grow as methods are developed to better link reduced models and more complex models, both from top-down and bottom-up approaches.

Introduction:

The standard parameter values for both the subsystems and the reduced model
equations (1)–(4) (equations (9)–(12) in the main text) are supplied in the table provided.
These parameter values are selected to remain within the given ranges and constraints
found in the experimental literature as well as in unpublished data. Details on the
derivation of these ranges are given below. Parameters that could not be documented
from existing data were estimated such that the subsystems behave in a biologically
appropriate manner for all physiologically relevant levels of the anti-inflammatory
mediator. Furthermore, when the pathogenic insult is replaced by endotoxin as an
initiating event, as presented in Day et al. (2006), the resulting model exhibits observed
biological behaviors of the immune mediators during repeated endotoxin administrations

<a id='42f1b500-161b-4194-94d5-e688c6154480'></a>

Units for N*, CA, and D cannot be determined, since they represent various types of cells, signaling proteins such as cytokines, and/or other mediators concurrently. These variables quantify the response of the immune function they represent rather than, for example, an exact cell count. Correspondingly, units of most parameters related to these variables are not in conventional form, but rather in terms of the associated variable. How parameters are estimated in relation to a given subsystem is detailed below along with comments for documented parameters.

1)

The non-specific local immune response/pathogen (_M_/_P_) subsystem with the _M_ equation in quasi state gave rise to the first two terms of the pathogen equation, equation (1).
The parameters in these terms were fit such that the pathogen equation is bistable for kpg below 1.5/hr, which is where the health state loses stability. The kpg level 1.5 was chosen such that for most physically observed pathogen growth rates the outcome of health is stable.

2)

The activated phagocytes/pathogen (N*/P) subsystem was fit such that for low pathogen growth rate (kpg) health is the only stable state, and at a moderately high kpg septic death exists and is stable. Parameters in this subsystem were first estimated so that these general dynamics occurred for a significant range of the physiologically possible levels of the anti-inflammatory mediator. They were then adjusted so that the reduced model and the altered model for endotoxin (Day et al., 2006) exhibited observed biological behaviors of the immune mediators in the presence of pathogen (see comment 4) and endotoxin, respectively.

The activated phagocytes/tissue damage (N*/D) subsystem was initially fit such that for physiologically relevant levels of the anti-inflammatory mediator the system is bistable between health and aseptic death with a reasonable basin of attraction for the health state. Adjustments were then made so that the reduced model and the altered model for

endotoxin (Day et al., 2006) exhibited observed biological behaviors of the immune
mediators the presence of pathogen (see comment 4) and endotoxin, respectively.

4)
Once the anti-inflammatory mediator (CA) was incorporated in the model as a dynamic
variable, the parameters where adjusted so that the reduced model now has the
following behavior (1) the model is bistable between the health and aseptic death states
for low kpg with a plausible basin of attraction for the health state, (2) for moderate to high
kpg all three states (health, aseptic death, and septic death) are stable, and (3) as kpg
continues to increase the health state and the aseptic death state lose stability.

The parameter, *kpm*, quantifies the ability of the local non-specific immune response to clear pathogen. This response is comprised of local factors such as defensins, local macrophages, and non-specific antibodies (e.g. IgA's). This response is considered to be less efficient than the phagocyte driven response, which yields the constraint *kpm*<*kpn*.
The value of this parameter was estimated such that the local non-specific immune response can be overwhelmed with a modest to large inoculum of pathogen.

The Rate at which the local non-specific immune response is exhausted, kmp, was set so
that kpmSm / µm = 1.5/hr.

7)

The parameter, *s*m, representing the source of the local non-specific immune response
(*M*) was estimated to balance, μm, the decay rate of *M*. These parameters are closely
related since the ratio *k*p*m*s*m*/μm=1.5/hr and at health state *M* =*S*m/μm.

The range for the decay rate of the non-specific local immune response, m, was based
on the reported half-lives of immunoglobulin G and A, which are non-specific antibodies
probably key in this response. These half-lives were documented in the textbook
Immunobiology Fig. 4.16 on page 143 (Janeway, Jr. et al., 2001) and Table 1 of Zouali
et al. (2001).

Though changed throughout our simulations, the physiologically relevant range for the growth rate of pathogen, *k*<sub>pg</sub>, was taken from Todar's Online Textbook of Bacteriology (Todar, 2002), which uses references from Spector's textbook, Handbook of Biological Data (Spector, 1956).

The maximum pathogen level, p∞, was estimated from a lethal model of E.coli rat peritonitis from unpublished data received via personal communication with Y. Vodovotz.

We based our estimation for the maximum of **kpn**, the rate at which activated phagocytes consume pathogen, on the observed mean rate of phagocytosis by macrophages in the presence of unlimited supply of particles up to 20 microns. This result is from the abstract of Branwood et al. (1992). This is taken as the maximum since the supply of pathogen is limited under normal circumstances.

The parameter, k_nn, corresponding to the rate of activation of resting phagocytes by
those previously activated, was estimated while to ensure μ_n > s_nr k_nn / μ_nr. This inequality
must hold for the health state to be stable.

The source of resting phagocytes, _s_nr, was set to ensure a stable concentration of resting phagocytes (_N_R) in the health state. As with the other source parameter, _s_m, this _s_nr was adjusted to balance the decay rate of resting phagocytes. These parameters are related since at health _N_R = _s_nr / _μ_nr.

The range for the decay rate of the resting phagocytes, μnr, was calculated from the half-lives (6-20 hours) of circulating neutrophils presented in Coxon et al. (1999).

15)
The half-life of activated phagocytes, μn, is longer than the half-life of resting
phagocytes, μnr, due to delayed apoptosis in the activated population; therefore μn< μnr
(Coxon et al., 1999).

The peak of the activated phagocyte response elicited from pathogen, k_np, is greater
than that triggered by damage, k_nd; therefore, k_nd < k_np.

The minimum for *μd*, which represents tissue repair, resolution, and regeneration, was estimated from data in Wang et al. (1999). We used the half-life of HMG-1 (HMGb-1), since it is a histone tethering protein leaked by damaged cells as a surrogate for the

many danger molecules that perpetuate the inflammatory signal. Wang and colleagues
give data for HMG-1 levels during an inflammatory response to bacterial
lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Therefore, we estimated the lower limit as the slope of the
data shown in Fig. 1C of Wang et al. (1999) during the decay phase of HMG-1. It would
be unrealistic to set μd to a value higher than the time constant of a recognized marker
of cellular injury.

i.e. 1 / (1 + (C_A / c_∞)^2) ≈ 3/4, when C_A reaches maximum value in response to an insult. We

<a id='c76ee341-c633-4f34-bd97-d89bae282e1d'></a>

set this to be approximately 75% because Fig. 6B in Isler et al. (1999) shows that when the anti-inflammatory mediator, IL-10, is blocked with anti-IL10 there is approximately a 75% increase in the production of IL-12 (a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by activated phagocytes).

Organisms have constitutive levels of anti-inflammatory effectors. Therefore the source
parameter, **s**c, was chosen to balance the corresonding documented half-life, µc. These
parameters are related because at the health state CA = Sc/ µc.

Anti-inflammatory signals have downstream cellular effects not explicitly modeled herein,
lasting longer than the effector cytokines or molecules producing them. Therefore, the
value for με was set at the lower limit of reported half-lives of anti-inflammatory effectors,

The Hill coefficient for equation (3) was set to six so that the response of tissue damage to activated phagocytes is not hypersensitive. A lower Hill coefficient would not appropriately represent this. In other words, it is biologically plausible that low levels of activated phagocytes do not trigger significant amounts of damage that could lead to a positive feedback capable of sustaining aseptic death. Also, for values six and higher, there was not a significant difference in the sensitivity of damage to the activated phagocytes. Contrary to the common inference regarding the use of Hill coefficients in enzymatic kinetics, we are not implying that a cooperativity-based mechanism is at work.
