## ABSTRACT

IL-6 has been proposed to favor the development of Th2 responses and play an important role in the communication between cells of multicellular organisms. They are involved in the regulation of complex cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and act as key player during inflammation and immune response. Th2 cytokines play an immunoregulatory role in early infection. Literature says in mice infected with *L. major*, IL-6 may promote the development of both Th1 and Th2 responses. IL-4 is also considered to be the signature cytokine of Th-2 response. IL-10 was initially characterized as a Th2 cytokine but later on it was proved to be a pleiotropic cytokine, secreted from different cell types including the macrophages. A major challenge is to understand how these complex non-linear processes are connected and regulated. Systems biology approaches may be used to tackle this challenge in an iterative process of quantitative mathematical analysis. In this study, we created an *in silico* model of IL6 mediated macrophage activation which suffers from an excessive impact of the negative feedback loop involving SOCS3. The strategy adopted in this framework may help to reduce the complexity of the leishmanial IL6 model analysis and also laydown various physiological or pathological conditions of IL6 signaling in future.

## 1. Introduction

Leishmaniasis is the second most neglected tropical disease after malaria in terms of parasitic disease mortality. It is caused by intracellular protozoan parasite from the genus Leishmania and transmitted through the bite of phlebotomine sandfly which acts as an intermediate host. The disease is associated with the socio-economic status of people. Malnutrition, population displacement, poor housing, environment fluctuation, a weak immune system and lack of resources are the major reasons that causes high disease endemicity in many part of the world including countries of Asia, Africa, South Europe, Central and South America [1]. Every year approximately 0.2 to 0.4 million of visceral leishmaniasis cases and 0.7 to 1.3 million of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases have been reported which causes annual death of 20,000-30,000 worldwide [1].

<a id='e9db0b5c-1c7a-42ec-944f-6fe1f09f973b'></a>

With reference to leishmaniasis, IL6 has been detected in the serum level of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) [2] and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) patient [3] and found to be reduced in VL patient after treatment [2]. This indicates the role of IL6 in pathogenesis of *Leishmania*. Interleukin 6 (IL6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a crucial role in many biological processes including activation of immune system, metabolism, bone homeostasis, pathological pain and in regenerative processes of the body. Together with IL1beta and TNFalpha, IL6 have been elevated in many of the auto immunity and inflammatory disease like

rheumatoid arthritis, bowel disease and castle man disease [4,5] IL6 has both pro inflammatory and anti-inflammatory action [6], therefore, its role in leishmaniasis is critical to determine. Some studies suggested that IL6 knockout mice showed enhanced control over infection with rapid parasite killing and stimulation of anti-leishmanial Th1 response: increased levels of circulating gamma interferon, accelerated granu- loma assembly, and heightened responsiveness to chemotherapy [7]. Further, studies on IL6 deficient C57BL/6 against L. major infection showed increased IFNy concentration in lymph node and decreased foot pad diameter with respect to L. major infected IL6 positive C57BL/6 [8]. This shows that there is an efficient immunity against leishmania in- fection in absence of IL6. Although, a study related to L. amazonensis infection shows that IL6 alone has no effect on macrophage viability and killing of parasite inside but pretreatment with IL6 has dose and time dependent inhibition of TNF alpha and IFN gamma signaling [9]. This clearly indicates anti-inflammatory action of IL6 during leishma- niasis. There are other studies which shows that the complex interac- tion of leishmania parasite to macrophage treated with LPS causes suppression of LPS induced inflammatory response [10]. From these studies, it is clear that the host-parasite interaction causes strong anti- inflammatory action to deactivate macrophage.

<a id='a06bba90-6bc5-478d-ba94-973f70dfa950'></a>

Turning towards host-parasite interaction there are lot of transcriptomics studies that has been done related to differential gene expression during leishmanial infection. There are around 218 genes

which were differentially expressed between uninfected and infected L. braziliensis human macrophage [11]. Major part of the gene belong to cytokine & chemokines as well as metabolic pathway [11,12]. Further studies reveal that L. braziliensis infection to human macrophage also causes differential expression of IFN gamma cytokine. Infected macrophage with low IFN gamma production shows higher expression of IL6, TLR2 as well as JAK 2 genes [13]. This further indicates the anti-inflammatory role of IL6 in leishmaniasis.

The complex host parasite interaction starts with the exposure of Lipophosphoglycan (a component of Leishmania cell membrane) to Toll like receptor 2 present on macrophages leads to the activation of NFkB, thereby, causes release of IL6 and many other proinflammatory cytokines from macrophages [14–16]. The initial interaction of parasite with toll like receptors plays a crucial role in shaping the immune response. MyD88, an adaptor molecule in TLR signaling is found to play role in clearance of _L. major_ during infection in macrophage [15]. This shows that MyD88 dependent TLR signaling has been activated during _L. major_ infection. Moreover, out of other molecule such as GIPL, gp80, LPG is only found to interact with TLR2 and trigger expression of pro inflammatory genes [15]. TLR2 interact with either TLR1 or TLR6 [17]. Therefore, studying evolutionary conservedness among TLRs from different species can be an effective tool to find out the probable conserved TLRs that could be targeted by parasite for specific signaling. Besides, proinflammatory cytokine, TLR signaling are found to cause STAT1 and STAT3 gene expression [18] as well as its phosphorylation through ERK activation in leishmaniasis [15] and other infectious diseases. Thus, besides IL6 signaling, MyD88 dependent TLR signaling as well as ERK activation pathway both are crucial to study the specific immune response in cutaneous leishmaniasis. The above extensive body of published literature clearly suggests the anti-inflammatory role of IL6 in leishmaniasis but its mechanism is still unknown. Therefore the present work focuses to find out the mechanism through which IL6 is mediating macrophage polarization during leishmania infection by using murine cutaneous leishmaniasis as a model system.

<a id='f7a8e4fd-20bc-4bae-82f5-f4fd0a299e3b'></a>

IL6 signaling occurs through the complex of IL6-IL6Receptor which leads to the homodimerization of gp130 glycoprotein which is ubiquitously present on every cell membrane [19]. IL6 signals through two ways: IL6 bind to membrane bounded IL6R (mbIL6R) and perform homodimerization of gp130 which leads to signal transduction. This is called IL6 classical signaling [4,5]. Whereas IL6 binds to soluble form of IL6R (sIL6R) and mediate IL6 signal transduction in cell which don't express mbIL6R, called as IL6 Trans signaling. Classical signaling is correlated with anti-inflammatory or regenerative response whereas trans signaling is meant for pro-inflammatory response [20] IL6 is known to activate STAT1 and STAT3 as well as SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression respectively [21]. SOCS (Suppressor of cytokine signaling) is a negative regulator of JAK-STAT pathway. It occurs in eight form CIS and SOCS1-SOCS7 [22]. SOCS1 and SOCS3 are found to function in macrophage polarization (conversion of macrophage into M1 or M2 phenotype) [23]. Literature review suggested that the leishmania infection causes differential expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in macrophages [24]. IL6 signaling induced JAK STAT-1 pathway is meant for M1 polarization whereas M2 Polarization is governed by IL6 induced JAK-STAT3 pathway [25]. Further studies revealed that higher expression of SOCS1 and lower expression of SOCS3 would result in the expression of Arginase I that eventually contribute to M2 phenotype [26]. From the above discussion, we propose that the ratio of phosphorylated SOCS1/SOCS3 induced by IL6 signaling may determine the macrophage polarization in _Leishmania major_ infected murine macrophage. To establish this hypothesis, we are using systems biology approach through which we are trying to establish link between TLR2-TLR1/TLR6 and IL6 signaling pathway in _L. major_ infected macrophages in the _in silico_ conditions, which would be later validated in wet lab. Using computational tools, mathematical model of anti-inflammatory (diseased) and pro-inflammatory (healthy) state of macrophage is generated to show the effect of IL6 in polarization of

macrophage during infection. The model system was created using
above literature evidences as well as the theoretical modelling.

## 2. Materials and methods

To understand the role of interleukin 6 in progression of leishmaniasis, systems biology approaches are used. Bits and pieces of information are collected from literature survey to reconstruct and analyze TLR2-TLR1/6-IL6 pathway network.

a. Phylogenetic Analysis: Phylogenetics is a powerful tool to decipher the evolutionary relationship between different species in terms of protein and its functionality. The present work focuses on Toll Like Receptor protein which is the target receptors of the parasite, therefore, DNA sequences of various TLRs (TLR1-TLR10) from different species of vertebrata subphylum were retrieved from NCBI and phylogenetic tree was constructed using Mr. Bayes 3.2.5 which employs Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (Supplementary figures). Phylogenetic tree provide us information about outgroup species which is further used to construct molecular clock of particular TLR. The resultant molecular clock provides information about evolutionary conservedness of various TLRs. The results can be evaluated in terms of Highest posterior density interval (HPD). In, Bayesian statistic, HPD is equivalent to the confidence interval. The accelerating molecular clock with 95% HPD value > 1 shows divergence whereas decelerating molecular clock with 95% HPD value < 1 shows conservedness during the course of evolution.

b. Reconstruction of signaling network: Reconstruction of signaling network is done to get a deeper insight of interaction between the protein molecules involved in the network. Biological systems are dynamic in nature; interactions between components will decide the outcome of the system. Quantitative modelling of the biological system contains parameters, kinetics, quantities of the molecular components involved in the network. In this study, two pathways are reconstructed to form a network which eventually decides the fate of macrophages (healthy or diseased). The pathways are TLR2-TLR1/6 and IL6 mediated JAK-STAT pathway. The concentrations of few components are available in the literature which was fed in the model and simulation was performed (see Table 1).

For the purpose MATLAB SimBiology toolbox (7.11.1.866) (The Mathworks Inc.) is used which is based on Systems biology markup language (SBML).

c. **Parameter estimation**: The chemical reactions are entered in SimBiology toolbox; adequate kinetic law (mass action for association and dissociation reactions, Henri-Michaelis-Menten for phosphorylation/dephosphorylation/ubiquitination, Hills equation for gene expression) is applied followed by parameter estimation. The reconstructed network was numerically simulated using Stiff Deterministic ODE15s solver (SimBiology toolbox) which generates the first order non-linear ODEs for each node, thus, defining the mathematical framework of the model [29].

d. **Sensitivity analysis**: The term sensitivity analysis (SA) has different meanings in different disciplines. With respect to the biological system, Nestorov (1999) has described SA as "the systematic investigation of the model responses to either (i) perturbations of the model quantitative factors (e.g. inputs and/or parameters) or (ii) variations in the model qualitative factors (e.g. structure, connectivity modules or submodels)" [30]. Not all the parameters are known while building computational based biological model, therefore there is always uncertainty in parameter values which reflects uncertainty in the output of the model. SA will reduce the uncertainties associated with the estimated parameter and thus built confidence in the model. SimBiology sensitivity analysis uses the "complex-step approximation" to calculate derivatives of reaction rates. It calculates the time-dependent sensitivities of all the species states with respect to species initial conditions and parameter values in the model. Thus, if a model has species x and two parameters y, and z, then the time-dependent sensitivities of x with respect to each parameter value can be represented as the time-dependent derivatives as Eq. dx/dy, dx/dz where the numerators are the sensitivity output and the denominators are the sensitivity inputs to sensitivity analysis.
e. **Network Analysis**: Network analysis is important for data integration and analysis. Biological construction of network is based on graph theory postulated by Leonhard Euler in 1736. Mathematically, a network is known as graph which has nodes representing components of network and edges or vertices representing interacting between components. Graph can be directed or undirected [31]. With respect to the biological network, directed graphs mean flow of information into a direction. In the present study, network reconstructed falls under directed graph category. To visualize topology of reconstructed network Cytoscape (2.8.2) was used and analysis is done after simulated annealing of the signaling network. Number of properties analyzed included degree of node, cluster of coefficient, average shortest path length, diameter of network, betweenness centrality and closeness centrality.
f. **Crosstalk point analysis**: Cross talks are the components that connect two or more pathway in a signaling network. They impart non-linearity to the signaling network and thus can be crucial point of regulation of network. Here, cross talk points were analyzed by subtracting degree of a node in a pathway to overall degree of node in a network. The "non-zero" value implies those component to be the cross talk point in the network [32].
g. **Flux Analysis**: Flux analysis was previously used with respect to the metabolic network to find out the rate at which metabolite in metabolic network is synthesized. Reaction with greater flux is significant in network because the rate at which the product is synthesized will decide the outcome of the network. In recent years, it has been used with respect to signaling network studies also. For this

<a id='4b05d653-b808-4447-9036-290d44f3ee06'></a>

purpose, Copasi (4.8.35), a simulator for biochemical networks is used. Time dependent concentrations of component are also calculated using Copasi (4.8.35) [33].
h. **Principle Component Analysis**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a classical tool used for analyzing biological networks, measures variance in a multivariant data and hence a multidimensional scaling. PCA does the linear transformation of multivariant data into a low dimension space that details maximum amount of information related to variables. PCA was done in MATLAB using the function i.e. [score, coefficient] = princomp (A) where, "A" is the m * n matrix of sensitivity coefficients of each species in the signaling network [29].
i. **Model Reduction**: Model reduction is one of the important steps in analyzing any biological network. Model reduction eliminates those reactions which don't significantly affects the outcome of the signaling network, thus, reducing the dimensionality of the network. In other words, it simplifies a step towards construction of the sophisticated network. For this purpose, flux, sensitivity and concentration of the component at the time of highest sensitivity are taken into consideration [29,33].

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Phylogenetic analysis

Evolutionary conservedness of TLRs among various species forms the basis to predict possible target of leishmania parasite for specific signaling. From the analysis, we found that TLR2, TLR6, TLR9 and TLR10 are found to be conserved during the entire course of evolution. As per the literature, TLR2 interacts with LPG, is found to be conserved, therefore, leishmania parasite must be targeting conserved receptors so as to infect the whole class of mammals. Furthermore, TLR2 heterodimerize only with TLR1 or TLR6, therefore, from the analysis we conclude that the interaction of parasite to TLR through LPG may cause the heterodimerization of TLR2-TLR6 for specific signaling in leishmaniasis (see Fig. 1 and Table 2).

3.2. Model reconstruction and simulation

3.2.1. Healthy state model
The network created has 3 compartments viz., membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus, 42 components (signaling proteins), 37 reactions, 54 parameters and 37 kinetic laws. The model was simulated for 80 units (time) using 15s ODE solver to obtain a desired behavior, in graphic format. The network shows the formation of four components as end product i.e., SOCS3 & AIF from JAK-STAT3 pathway and SOCS1 & iNOS from JAK-STAT1pathway. The JAK-STAT3 pathway will be shut down due to the insertion of negative feedback loop of SOCS3 acting

over JAK1/2, therefore AIF and SOCS3 production will cease whereas JAK STAT1 pathway will remain the same, ultimately, resulting in the formation of iNOS. The graph shows the production of iNOS (Fig. 2) indicating the healthy state of macrophage.

The production of iNOS is nil due to shut down of JAK STAT1 pathway by negative feedback loop insertion of SOCS1 (Fig. 3) (see Tables 3 and 4).

These are cytoplasmic phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT1 (see Fig. 4).
STAT3 shows overall 4 degree in the reconstructed network where 2
degree found in TLR2-TLR6/1 pathway which shows that 2 degree must
be from IL6 signaling pathway. As compared to STAT3, STAT1 shows
overall 5 degree in the network, in which 2 degree belong to TLR2-
TLR6/1 pathway, 1 degree belong to IFN gamma pathway therefore 2
degree is from IL6 signaling pathway.

### 3.3.2. Principal component analysis (PCA)
PCA extracts those components that may have important effect on the output of the network. In healthy state model, component having highest PCA scores are cytoplasmic phosphorylated STAT1, nuclear homodimerized STAT1, Il6R receptor, membrane IL6-IL6R-gp130 complex, nuclear SOCS1, and cytoplasmic SOCS3 whereas, in diseased state model, cytoplasmic homodimerized STAT3, cytoplasmic SOCS1, and AIF are components which shows high PCA score. PCA scores of the sensitivities show that any change in the parameters associated with these signaling components may affect the whole network in terms of its output, and may be considered as future intervention points to allow modulation from a M2 phenotype to M1 phenotype (see Fig. 5).

3.3.3. Flux analysis
To mimic the negative feedback loop condition in cell, parameters for some reaction were set at "0", therefore their calculated flux come out to be '0'. These reactions are SOCS1 inhibiting IL6 and IFNg mediated JAK2/1-STAT1 activation in diseased state and SOCS3 inhibiting Il6 mediated JAK1/2-STAT3 activation in healthy state. These reactions have been ignored in flux analysis. Reactions that show change in the flux are represented in Fig. 6. Comparison between flux of both networks shows that the production of iNOS is increased after negative feedback loop of SOCS3 inhibiting JAK1/2-STAT3 pathway in healthy state whereas production of AIF is increased after inhibition of JAK1/2-STAT1 pathway by SOCS1 and high AIF production indicate, M2 phenotype i.e. diseased state.

## 4. Discussion

The pleiotropic cytokine Interleukin 6 is a well-known pro in-flammatory cytokine. Its role has been elucidated in many in-flammatory and auto immune disease. But when it comes to dual character of cytokine, it is difficult to predict the exact mechanism through which a single cytokine is actually functioning in two different ways. The point at which the cytokine is shifting its role or we can say that the proteins that are involved in switching mechanism can be very well studied through systems biology approaches. Systems biology is an interconnecting branch that employs all the possible approaches to study a hypothesis driven problem. Mathematical modelling involves various enzyme kinetics as well as key parameters that provide an overall quantitative picture of all the proteins involved in a signaling network, thus gives us an insight to predict the best possible mechanism responsible for the two distinct role of a particular cytokine. The pre-diction made through computational modelling may be proved in _in vitro_ as well as in _in vivo_ condition for further refinement of the mathematical model. Model refinement is an iterative process, requires constant computational as well as wet lab validation. Once the desired refinement is achieved the model can, not only be used to get deeper insight of pertaining mechanism but also may be used to get ther-apeutical targets aiming to solve complicated mechanism of various diseases. In the present work, we employed systems biology approaches to evaluate the dual character (i.e. pro and anti-inflammatory) of in-terleukin 6 cytokine in leishmaniasis. Through JAK-STAT3 signaling, it perform its anti-inflammatory role as well as through JAK-STAT1 sig-naling it perform its pro-inflammatory function. The quantitative

mathematical modelling of signaling related to IL6 shows that ratio of SOCS1 to SOCS3 is actually imparting dual character to its functioning. The ratio is 6 times higher in the diseased state than in healthy state showing that the increased SOCS1 concentration is eventually shutting down all the pro inflammatory signaling pathway, which apparently results in M2 polarization of macrophages. Besides this, further statis- tical analysis, included sensitivity, flux and principle component ana- lysis results in churning out the key reaction governing IL6 induced signaling in leishmaniasis. The process is termed as model reduction. In model reduction, there are few reactions which are upregulated only when the leishmania infection progresses into severity of the disease and few are those reactions which contribute to immunity against the parasite. Besides these two types of reaction, there are other reactions which plays an important role in both the cases as discussed above; one being the formation of IL6-IL6R-gp130 complex. Further literature evidences suggested that this complex is a key mediator of activation of STAT1 and STAT3 as well as a site for the inhibitory action of SOCS

Thus, the system approaches are helping us to provide a major lead to dwell into the structural aspect of IL6-IL6R-gP130 complex and find out the key interfacial residues involved in the activation of STATs as well as inhibitory action of SOCSs proteins. These key residues may further be used to design therapeutics for anti-leishmanial effect.
