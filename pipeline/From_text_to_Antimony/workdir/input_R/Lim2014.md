* A balance between proviral activation and latency aids viral persistence.
* Immune efficiency depends on rate of lysis and not on abundance of effector cells.
* Proviral activation may distinguish clinical status independent of proviral load.
* We hypothesise that crossing an activation threshold could increase risk of disease.

ABSTRACT
Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) causes chronic infection for which there is no cure or neutralising vaccine. HTLV-I has been clinically linked to the development of adult T-cell leukaemia/ lymphoma (ATL), an aggressive blood cancer, and HAM/TSP, a progressive neurological and inflammatory disease. Infected individuals typically mount a large, persistently activated CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response against HTLV-I-infected cells, but ultimately fail to effectively eliminate the virus. Moreover, the identification of determinants to disease manifestation has thus far been elusive.
A key issue in current HTLV-I research is to better understand the dynamic interaction between persistent infection by HTLV-I and virus-specific host immunity. Recent experimental hypotheses for the persistence of HTLV-I in vivo have led to the development of mathematical models illuminating the balance between proviral latency and activation in the target cell population. We investigate the role of a constantly changing anti-viral immune environment acting in response to the effects of infected T-cell activation and subsequent viral expression. The resulting model is a four-dimensional, non-linear system of ordinary differential equations that describes the dynamic interactions among viral expression, infected target cell activation, and the HTLV-I-specific CTL response. The global dynamics of the model is established through the construction of appropriate Lyapunov functions. Examining the particular roles of viral expression and host immunity during the chronic phase of HTLV-I infection offers important insights regarding the evolution of viral persistence and proposes a hypothesis for pathogenesis.

## 1. Introduction
Human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is a persistent human retrovirus that infects between 10 and 25 million individuals world-wide (Bangham, 2000; Gallo, 2005; Goncalves et al., 2010; Mortreux et al., 2003; Proietti et al., 2005). It is the causative

agent of two major, clinically independent diseases: an aggressive blood cancer called adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATL), and a slowly progressive neurological and inflammatory disease, HAM/ TSP. Despite significant advances over the past three decades, there still remain questions about the way in which HTLV-I- infected cells successfully evade a vigorous and chronically acti- vated virus-specific host immune response mediated primarily by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) or the so-called 'killer T-cells' (Asquith and Bangham, 2007, 2008; Bangham et al., 2009, 1999). Furthermore, the precise mechanisms for the development of HTLV-I-associated diseases are unknown (Asquith and Bangham,

HTLV-I, and neither is there an effective treatment available for
HTLV-I-associated pathologies — infection is life-long (Bangham,

A key unresolved issue in current HTLV-I research is how the virus is able to persist despite strong immune pressure and the implications of viral persistence on the outcome of infection. The focus of this paper is to develop a consistent theoretical frame-work that can help shed light on specific, biologically relevant questions that are of interest to experimentalists and theoretical immunologists trying to understand the complicated host–patho-gen dynamics of chronic viral infections such as HTLV-I. We will investigate these questions using a mathematical modelling approach. Mathematical modelling can help us break apart the complex mechanisms of HTLV-I persistence and identify the underlying principles that govern successful viral propagation in the presence of host immunity. Understanding these interactions is a crucial step on the road to developing effective ways to disrupt the virus life-cycle and may help identify promising new treat-ment strategies to reduce the severity of HTLV-I infection and minimise the detriment due to the associated disease. More specifically, we formulate a mathematical model in order to elucidate the following:

<a id='e5e895a8-ca89-4e1a-bd62-85f0ace9e792'></a>

1.  Since viral activation exposes infected cells to immune-mediated surveillance, why is HTLV-I not silent? In other words, what benefit does the HTLV-I provirus gain in becoming activated and expressing viral antigens?
2.  What determines the strength of the HTLV-I-specific CTL response, and why is infection life-long? That is, how can we evaluate the quality of the HTLV-I-specific CTL response, and why does host immunity fail to eradicate the virus?
3.  What characterises HTLV-I-linked pathology? Indeed, how can one determine the severity of viral detriment considering that the size of the proviral load is insufficient to classify clinical status? Can a mathematical modelling approach suggest an alternative, quantifiable measure to determine the outcome of the infection? If such a measure does exist, what implications might it have on the diagnosis, development, and treatment of HTLV-I-associated disease?

<a id='f50f3ffc-0f5e-465a-a4fe-929310b6be62'></a>

The organisation of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we
present our mathematical model, whose development has been
strongly motivated by the immunological dynamics of HTLV-I
infection in vivo, and motivate a biologically realistic range of
parameter values which are adopted in numerical simulations. In
Section 3, we discuss and establish the global qualitative beha-
viour present in the model. In Section 4, we distinguish two
important measures of viral detriment which our modelling
approach allows us to consider. Following this, we focus on the
biological applications and outcomes of our mathematical model
in Section 5, which we have subdivided into three themes
corresponding to the three points raised above. Namely, in
Section 5.1, we explore the effects of spontaneous viral expression
that accompanies infected T-cell activation to understand why
HTLV-I is not a completely silent infection. Then in Section 5.2, we
consider factors that define an effective virus-specific cellular
immune response and speculate why infection ultimately persists
despite the presence of anti-viral host immunity. Next, we exam-
ine our mathematical model in the context of pathology in
Section 5.3. Results from our investigations provide insights
regarding HTLV-I-associated disease and suggest a novel hypoth-
esis for pathogenesis. Lastly, in Section 6, we provide answers to
the biological questions posed above by summarising the

<a id='ede0742a-e28f-4ecc-9d1a-8315ac65ea51'></a>

biological conclusions arising from examination of our mathema-
tical model.

## 2. Methods

### 2.1. Mathematical model

Recently, Asquith and Bangham (2008) have proposed an experimental hypothesis for the infection and persistence of HTLV-I in vivo which motivated the formulation of a mathematical model by Li and Lim (2011) illustrating the balance between latency and activation in the target cell dynamics of the viral infection. In the model by Li and Lim (2011), the action of anti-viral host immunity was considered implicitly via fractions of newly infected cells that survive elimination. However, the pool of HTLV-I-specific immune effectors is highly dynamic and continuously changing in response to the virus population.

<a id='f2f5ac0e-8b6a-42a0-ab7d-321daaff42f0'></a>

As cellular immunity is widely believed to be the most significant factor in determining the outcome of infection, we extend the model by Li and Lim (2011) to incorporate the two key features of HTLV-I infection in vivo: (i) viral latency, and (ii) the HTLV-I-specific CTL response. The separation of infected target cells into two distinct compartments, latently infected and actively infected, is crucial to understanding the persistence of HTLV-I in the midst of a chronically stimulated anti-viral host immune response.

<a id='ce46cd9c-6674-489b-8bdd-3f119363e4d5'></a>

The primary target cells of HTLV-I infection are CD4+ helper T-cells, which we will initially separate into three different compartments. To model the explicit role of anti-viral cellular immunity, we also include an additional compartment of HTLV-I-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs). In particular, we define
x(t): density of healthy CD4+ helper T-cells at time t,
u(t): density of latently infected CD4+ helper T-cells at time t,
y(t): density of actively infected CD4+ helper T-cells at time t,
z(t): density of HTLV-I-specific CD8+ CTLs at time t.

<a id='5e3688b2-06f0-453f-ab61-0b5a46f7d26c'></a>

We consider a mathematical model of HTLV-I infection given by the following four-dimensional non-linear system of ordinary differential equations:

$$ \frac{dx}{dt} = \underbrace{\lambda}_{\text{T-cell production}} - \underbrace{\beta xy}_{\text{infectious transmission}} - \underbrace{\mu_1 x}_{\text{natural death}} $$

$$ \frac{du}{dt} = \underbrace{\beta xy}_{\text{infectious transmission}} + \underbrace{ry}_{\text{mitotic transmission}} - \underbrace{(\tau+\mu_2)u}_{\text{spontaneous activation & natural death}} $$

$$ \frac{dy}{dt} = \underbrace{\tau u}_{\text{spontaneous activation}} - \underbrace{\gamma yz}_{\text{CTL-mediated lysis}} - \underbrace{\mu_3 y}_{\text{natural death}} $$

$$ \frac{dz}{dt} = \underbrace{\nu y}_{\text{CTL proliferation}} - \underbrace{\mu_4 z.}_{\text{natural death}} \quad (1) $$

A schematic of the biological mechanism of HTLV-I infection in vivo upon which our model is based is shown for reference in Fig. 1.

<a id='d3513883-bbe9-4baa-8ac6-4b7be7def045'></a>

Let us now motivate each term one by one. Naïve CD4+ helper
T-cells are produced in the bone marrow, then migrate to the
thymus where they mature before being released into the periph-
eral blood. These mature CD4+ helper T-cells are initially unin-
fected and we describe their rate of entry into the periphery by a
constant λ. There are two routes of transmission for HTLV-I within
the target cell population: horizontal or 'infectious', and vertical or
'mitotic'. Infectious transmission requires direct contact between
an actively infected and a healthy target cell, and involves a
restructuring of the cell cytoskeleton to create a tight junction
known as a virological synapse, across which the viral genome is
transported from the infected target cell to the uninfected one
(Igakura et al., 2003; Shiraki et al., 2003). Upon infection, the
newly infected target cell silences viral expression and becomes

latently infected. The precise mechanisms behind the suppression of viral proteins are not yet understood (Asquith and Bangham, 2008). We describe the cell-to-cell virus transmission using a bilinear incidence term βx(t)y(t), where β is the coefficient of infectious transmissibility. The mitotic route of transmission occurs when an actively infected target cell divides, creating two genetically identical daughter cells (Bangham, 2000). One way to represent the mitotic route of viral transmission is to assume that the proliferation of actively infected cells follows a logistic growth pattern given by a term ry(t)(1-(x(t)+u(t)+y(t))/k), where r is the rate of rapid selective division, and k is the carrying capacity of CD4+ helper T-cells. However, from studies of T-cell dynamics, the proliferation and removal rates of CD4+ helper T-cells have been quantified (Asquith et al., 2007; Kirschner and Webb, 1996; Nelson et al., 2000), and suggest that the maximum proliferation rate is in general less than the rates due to natural death. Thus, it is plausible that even in the presence of rapid selective mitotic division, target cell populations do not exceed the total CD4+ helper T-cell carrying capacity. We have investigated numerically the dynamics of the model using a full logistic growth term and observed no qualitative difference in the behaviour of trajectories (see Figs. B1 and B2 in Appendix B). Hence, with respect to our model we will assume that x(t)+u(t)+y(t) <k for all t≥ 0, so that the proliferation of actively infected target cells follows an expo- nential growth profile. As a result, we choose to represent infected T-cell proliferation using an exponential growth term ry(t) rather than a logistic growth term. As with infectious transmission, newly infected target cells via mitotic division immediately hide the expression of viral genes, thus entering the latently infected cell compartment and subsequently evading the immune system. At this point, we would like to remark that although mitosis is a process that occurs in all target cells, it has been experimentally shown that the rapid rate of infected target cell proliferation is significantly faster than normal homeostatic division (Asquith et al., 2007), but only during intermittent expression of the provirus (Asquith and Bangham, 2008; Richardson et al., 1997), coinciding in our model with the pool of actively infected target cells. Latently infected target cells do not express the provirus and proliferate at the same rate as normal, healthy CD4+ helper T-cells. To avoid unne- cessarily complicating the model equations, we do not consider the passive proliferation of healthy and latently infected target cells.

<a id='f739a65c-e64b-4688-a461-71de942fd711'></a>

Latency allows the proviral cell to escape lysis by anti-HTLV-I
CTLs, but hinders both the infectious and mitotic routes of viral
transmission. Meanwhile, activation promotes viral transmission,
but simultaneously exposes the proviral cell to immune surveil-
lance (Asquith and Bangham, 2008). It is becoming increasingly
clear that a dynamic balance between infected target cell latency

<a id='21e108be-4a43-4678-a957-516c2fe73080'></a>

and activation exists. Indeed, while the vast majority of proviral cells are latent at any given time Richardson et al. (1997), it has been observed experimentally that a small proportion of latently infected CD4+ helper T-cells spontaneously express viral proteins and become actively infected (Asquith et al., 2000; Asquith and Bangham, 2008; Asquith et al., 2007). We represent the transition of a proviral cell from the latently infected state to the actively infected state by a term τu(t), where τ is the rate of spontaneous infected T-cell activation or viral protein expression. In the activated state, proviral cells are subject to strong selection by HTLV-I-specific CTLs that recognise expressed HTLV-I antigens, such as epitopes on the immunodominant virus protein Tax and the minus-strand viral gene product HBZ (Gaudray et al., 2002; Goon et al., 2004). We model the elimination of actively infected target cells by virus-specific CTLs using a bilinear incidence term γy(t)z(t), where γ represents the rate of CTL-mediated lysis. The pool of CTLs is maintained by antigenic stimulation from virus-expressing activated proviral cells (Asquith et al., 2007; Bangham et al., 2009). The replenishment of these CTLs is described by the term νy(t), where ν is the rate of CTL proliferation or turnover, also referred to as the CTL responsiveness (Nowak and Bangham, 1996; Wodarz et al., 2001).

<a id='86d841b3-af44-48fa-a2c2-38771bfb173e'></a>

Lastly, all T-cell populations under consideration, including CD4⁺
helper T-cells and CD8⁺ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), are removed
from the system via natural cell death. We represent the removal of
each cell type by a rate proportional to its density. Healthy, latently
infected, and actively infected target cells die at respective rates μ₁, μ₂, 
and μ₃, and the removal rate of CD8⁺ CTLs is μ₄.

<a id='fcf3295a-61cd-476d-a697-fd23a6b4dca6'></a>

All parameters are assumed to be positive. To close the model, we need to specify the initial conditions, and this is done in the next section.

2.2. Parameter values and numerical simulations

In this section, we discuss the parameter values that we use to simulate model (1), which have been estimated using both experimental and theoretical methods in studies of CD4+ lymphocyte kinetics by Kirschner and Webb (1996) and Nelson et al. (2000). Asquith et al. (2005, 2007) have also quantified the in vivo kinetics of CD4+ helper T-cells and CD8+ CTLs in the context of persistent infection by HTLV-I in both asymptomatic carriers and in HAM/TSP patients. The production λ of healthy CD4+ helper T-cells from the bone marrow falls in the range of 0-10 cells/mm³/day (Kirschner and Webb, 1996). As infection by HTLV-I only causes minor detriment to T-cell functionality (Asquith and Bangham, 2007), it is expected that all three populations of target cells considered in our model display natural death rates similar to

those of healthy target cells, with rates between 0.01 and 0.11 day⁻¹
(Kirschner and Webb, 1996; Nelson et al., 2000; Ribeiro et al., 2002).
Extracting from studies of HIV-1 infection (Ribeiro et al., 2002), it is
assumed that activated CD8⁺ CTLs die at similar rates in both
uninfected and infected individuals, with the death rate lying
between 0.03 and 0.05 day⁻¹. The rate of rapid Tax-driven selective
mitosis r lies within the range 0.01–0.045 day⁻¹ (Asquith et al., 2007;
Kirschner and Webb, 1996), with higher rates of CD4⁺ helper T-cell
turnover usually associated with disease status, e.g. HAM/TSP.

We consider values for the coefficient of infectious transmissibility
$\beta$ to be on the order of $10^{-3}$ mm³/cell/day, which is consistent with
those used in recent mathematical models of HTLV-I infection
(Gómez-Acevedo and Li, 2005; Gómez-Acevedo et al., 2010; Li and
Lim, 2011). Asquith et al. (2007) have quantified the rate of expression
$\tau$ of Tax in proviral cells to be between 0.0003 and 0.03 day$^{-1}$, and an
intermediary value of 0.003 day$^{-1}$ is chosen. The rate of lysis by anti-
HTLV-I CTLs $\gamma$ in asymptomatic carriers of the virus depends on each
individual, and has been measured to be between 0.007 and 0.220 per
CD8$^{+}$ cell per day with a median value of 0.029 day$^{-1}$ (Asquith et al.,
2005). Finally, the proliferation rate of HTLV-I-specific CD8$^{+}$ CTLs has
been measured to be in the range 0.009–0.161 day$^{-1}$ with a median
value of 0.036 day$^{-1}$ (Asquith et al., 2007). The biological meaning of
the parameters, the primary sources for the parameter ranges, and the
specific choices for the dimensional parameter values within the
relevant ranges are summarised in Table 1.

Before we can solve model (1), we discuss a biologically reasonable initial state of the system at the onset of infection. In the absence of infection, the normal CD4+ helper T-cell count averages 850 cells/mm3 of peripheral blood, although it is known that there is a wide variance between individuals, with healthy values in adolescents and adults ranging from 500 cells/mm3 to 1200 cells/mm3 (Bofill et al., 1992). 1

<a id='22c42575-a214-4c5b-9b35-d0bd2811760e'></a>

We assume that the individual is initially healthy, and that the
start of infection occurs after the introduction of a small dose of
infected cells, say on the order of 10-1 cells/mm³. Next, it is known

For reference, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is characterised by a CD4+ helper T-cell count below 200 cells/mm³.

<a id='1950afca-cdcb-4bb4-a580-91d39f09725e'></a>

that CTLs of a diverse range of specificities are continuously being produced. The average level of CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocytes in a normal, healthy individual is roughly 550 cells/mm3 of peripheral blood (Bofill et al., 1992). We will assume that at the start of infection, the number of circulating CD8+ CTLs in an individual that can recognise HTLV-I epitopes is on the order of 10⁻¹ cells/mm³. Here we remark that although the magnitude of the initial level of viraemia is small relative to the size of the target cell pool, these values, measured in units of cells per mm³ of peripheral blood, are assumed to be homogeneous throughout the entire body of an individual, whose blood volume is several orders of magnitude higher (~5.5 L of blood for an average human weighing roughly 70 kg). Thus, stochastic effects are negligible and we are justified in adopting a deterministic modelling approach.

To gain some insight as to how we will approach the mathematical analysis of model (1), we use these biologically motivated initial conditions and parameter values (summarised in Table 1), and run preliminary numerical simulations of the model. Using the built-in differential equation solver in Mathematica (version 9.0.1.0), we solve model (1) numerically and plot the solution as in Fig. 2. The NDSolve command in Mathematica automatically selects a numerical algorithm to optimally solve the designated system of ordinary differential equations, and includes both explicit and implicit methods such as Euler, Adams, and Runge-Kutta of arbitrary order. Fig. 2(a) shows all four cell populations and highlights their relative abundances. As the magnitudes of the terms in the u, y, z-equations are much smaller than those of the x-equation, we take a closer look at their behaviours by magnifying the vertical axis, roughly 30 times in Fig. 2(b) and 600 times in Fig. 2(c). We observe that after some time, the solution appears to settle at a positive equilibrium which may be reached by damped oscillations. In the following section of the paper, we will examine the underlying dynamical behaviour of model (1) in more detail.

<::Figure: A multi-panel figure showing numerical simulations of cell populations over time. The figure is composed of three line graphs labeled (a), (b), and (c). The x-axis for all graphs is "Time (days)", ranging from 0 to 1000. The y-axis for all graphs is "Cell Density (cells/mm³)".

(a) This graph shows the full dimensional range of all cell populations. The y-axis ranges from 0 to 800. A blue line, labeled "x(t)", starts at approximately 820 cells/mm³ and gradually decreases to stabilize around 760 cells/mm³. A green line, labeled "u(t)", starts at 0 and increases to stabilize at a low level, around 20-30 cells/mm³. Two lines, labeled "y(t)" and "z(t)", start at 0 and increase to very low levels, close to 5-10 cells/mm³, with y(t) (red) and z(t) (black) appearing very close to each other.

(b) This graph provides a closer examination of the behavior of u(t), y(t), and z(t). The y-axis ranges from 0 to 30. The green line, labeled "u(t)", rapidly increases from 0 to approximately 27 cells/mm³ by 200 days, then stabilizes. The red line, labeled "y(t)", and the black line, labeled "z(t)", both increase from 0 to very low levels, around 1-2 cells/mm³, and then stabilize. They remain very close to each other, significantly below u(t).

(c) This graph provides another closer examination, focusing on y(t) and z(t). The y-axis ranges from 0.0 to 1.4. The black line, labeled "z(t)", starts around 0.1 cells/mm³ and rapidly increases to approximately 1.4 cells/mm³ by 200 days, then stabilizes. The red line, labeled "y(t)", starts around 0.1 cells/mm³ and rapidly increases to approximately 1.1 cells/mm³ by 200 days, then stabilizes. The z(t) line is consistently higher than the y(t) line after the initial rise.

and unambiguously characterise model behaviour, allowing for a systematic way to draw inferences from the model results. A well-defined mathematical model also allows us to identify specific processes that can lead to experimental designs to test the validity of the model representation we have chosen and determine its applicability to the biological system under study.

The purpose of this section is to provide a complete mathema-
tical description of the global qualitative behaviour of all possible
solutions of model (1). Establishing the global dynamics of our
mathematical model means that we have a complete understand-
ing of the qualitative behaviour of solutions of the model. This puts
us in a position where we can fully explore the model without
having to worry about the occurrence of unexpected phenomena,
and allows us to draw robust conclusions from further investiga-
tions of the model in the remainder of this paper.

The first step in the mathematical analysis of model (1) is to determine a bounding region for the T-cell populations to ensure that our model is biologically reasonable. In particular, T-cell populations should neither become negative nor should they become unbounded. Our first result, Theorem 3.1, formalises such a notion. For the proof, the reader is referred to A.1. Denote by R⁴₊ the closed positive orthant of R⁴.

It can be seen from the model equations that for any set of non-
negative initial conditions, x, u, y, z ≥ 0 for all t ≥ 0. Let μ = min
{μ₁, μ₂, μ₃}, and consider the closed, bounded region:

<a id='2b7192fe-259e-4f86-a6a1-17b304ffeb76'></a>

$\Gamma := \{(x, u, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^4_+ : x \leq \frac{\lambda}{\mu_1}, x + u + y \leq \frac{\lambda}{\mu - r}, z \leq \frac{\lambda\nu}{\mu_4(\mu - r)}\}$

<a id='16278c64-7028-47ae-9261-82d35d81399d'></a>

The assumption that r<µ corresponds to experimental evi-dence indicating that the proliferation rate of CD4+ helper T-cells is generally lower than the rate of removal due to natural death (Asquith et al., 2007; Kirschner and Webb, 1996; Nelson et al., 2000), Therefore, Theorem 3.1 defines the set Γ as a biologically feasible region on which the model dynamics may be analysed.

The global behaviour of model (1) depends crucially on a key parameter, the _basic reproduction number_ for viral infection, defined as

<a id='d7025b24-e6c1-4d35-bb6e-b9b55bc4e71f'></a>

R₀ = \frac{\tau}{\mu_3(\tau+\mu_2)}(\beta x_H + r) \text{ where } x_H = \frac{\lambda}{\mu_1}. (2)

<a id='6a7670b3-7786-493d-953d-b5b3b9a69fa0'></a>

Biologically, R₀ represents the average number of secondary infected cells produced from a single actively infected cell over its lifetime. The expression for R₀ derived from model (1) displays a similar form to the one determined in the model by Li and Lim (2011).

<a id='a642e3fb-c4d8-4736-ab7b-e258655cca8f'></a>

The following theorem summarises our main mathematical result and establishes R₀ as a sharp threshold that characterises the global dynamics of model (1) in T̅. We refer the reader to Appendix A for a rigorous mathematical proof of the result, which has been separated into three parts to facilitate the ease of understanding. Appendix A.2 deals with the existence and unique- ness of equilibria, while Appendices A.3 and A.4, respectively, demonstrate the stability properties of the infection-free and chronic infection steady states, whenever they exist. The global dynamical behaviour of model (1) has been established using the direct method of Lyapunov, which has been successfully employed in proving the global stability of equilibria in population models from epidemiology (Kalajdzievska and Li, 2011; Korobeinikov and Wake, 2002) and immunology (Gómez-Acevedo et al., 2010; Korobeinikov, 2004).

## 4. Measures of viral burden

One of the most important tasks faced by clinicians after identifying an HTLV-I seropositive individual is to evaluate the severity of the infection. How much damage has the virus caused to the host? Is the infected individual asymptomatic or are there signs of chronic or malignant disease? For the former, is the individual at risk of developing symptoms? For the latter, how far and how fast has the disease progressed? The degree of detriment caused by the virus is termed the _viral burden_.

<a id='83573266-709a-44d6-a6a1-a20f2347b048'></a>

The most common measure of viral burden in the host is the
proviral load, and it is given by the proportion of all target cells in
the peripheral blood that carry a provirus, regardless of their state
of activation (Asquith et al., 2005; Asquith and Bangham, 2008).
With the advance of current experimental techniques, such a
measure, which simply reports the magnitude of the virus infec-
tion, is relatively easy to obtain from host sera and is frequently
reported in experimental data as a percentage of all peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Asquith et al., 2005). In terms of
our mathematical model, we define the proviral load at equili-
brium as the infected fraction of all CD4+ helper T-cells:

<a id='802d6100-c19d-459b-895f-4cfa003aa3f4'></a>

v* = (u* + y*) / (x* + u* + y*)                                       (3)

<a id='6e37d688-b6f7-4811-b50d-06ad051807c2'></a>

A defining characteristic of our mathematical modelling approach to HTLV-I infection is the separation of proviral cells into two distinct compartments based on infected target cell latency or activation. This allows us to consider how the two populations of proviral cells co-exist and how they persist as the infection propagates back and forth through the latent and activated states. In our model, the total number of infected target cells, both latent and active, at equilibrium is given by the expression (u*+y*). Thus, we can examine and define a second measure of viral burden to be the proportion of proviral cells that are activated, which is represented by the ratio:

## 5. Results and discussion

### 5.1. Exploring spontaneous viral expression: why is HTLV-I not silent?

<a id='0c1d74eb-fd61-423f-919c-4cc50589af20'></a>

In HTLV-I infection, the vast majority of proviral cells do not express viral proteins at any given time, an observation that lends support to the traditional viewpoint that HTLV-I is largely inactive (Asquith and Bangham, 2008; Asquith et al., 2007). Nevertheless, it has been shown that most HTLV-I seropositive individuals, regardless of clinical status, mount a vigorous virus-specific cellular immune response, suggesting continuous stimulation by expressed viral antigens and thereby raising the important question (Asquith et al., 2000): 'Is HTLV-I infection really silent?' This issue has recently been resolved by Asquith et al. (2007), who have demonstrated experimentally that each day, a small proportion of infected target cells spontaneously re-activate and express viral

<a id='fec9116b-09b9-4777-8c7d-bcda726e5f58'></a>

antigens. Such studies have been crucial in establishing that the strategy of HTLV-I infection is not that of complete latency, but one that is more dynamic.

<a id='ee672e63-8ada-4a61-9494-2f434a6feb3d'></a>

In light of our overall theme of understanding HTLV-I persis-tence, in this section, we consider the following conundrum: Why is HTLV-I not silent? Indeed, the expression of viral proteins accompanying infected T-cell activation exposes proviral cells to immune surveillance, resulting in the risk of destruction. If this is the case, then why would the evolution of HTLV-I favour a route for viral expression and activation rather than remaining comple-tely latent? The fact is that viral activation can be both beneficial and detrimental to the proviral cell. On the one hand, displaying viral proteins is required for infectious cell-to-cell transmission and is believed to drive the rapid, selective expansion of infected cells (Asquith and Bangham, 2008; Igakura et al., 2003). On the other hand, it simultaneously allows such cells to be eliminated by a persistently activated HTLV-I-specific CTL response (Asquith et al., 2005; Bangham, 2003). The balance between the two opposing selection forces determines the outcome of infection. To resolve our conundrum, we switch our perspective to that of the virus to understand why and how viral activation can be advantageous.

<a id='98105e85-c10d-42fc-bd5e-e01f9cc32609'></a>

Our mathematical model (1) explicitly incorporates the inter-
actions among the latent and active states of HTLV-I proviral cells,
and virus-specific CTLs. In particular, the transition from the
latently infected target cell compartment to the actively infected
target cell compartment is encapsulated in the parameter τ, the
rate of spontaneous viral expression that accompanies proviral
activation. We can therefore examine the impact of the parameter
τ on the long-term behaviour of model (1). Our results are
consistent with those of Li and Lim (2011), whose model explored
in detail the role of Tax expression on chronic HTLV-I infection, but
in the absence of a dynamically changing host immune response.

<a id='be0f5cd9-45f6-4249-9dc5-eb6126f8f521'></a>

5.1.1. _Tax/HBZ expression drives chronic infection and is an important determinant of proviral load_

The basic reproduction number for viral infection R₀, defined in Eq. (2), can be thought of as a measure of viral success with respect to the ability to establish and propagate the infection. A simple computation shows that R₀ is an increasing function of τ; that is, the rate of spontaneous viral activation is seen to be a factor that drives the system towards chronic infection, making it difficult for infected individuals to clear the virus.

<a id='1edcdab1-5f18-4ff3-85e9-aabde01916fc'></a>

Next, we explore the way in which the expression of viral proteins affects the proviral load. In Fig. 3, we have plotted numerically a curve from our mathematical model (1) showing the impact of the rate τ of spontaneous infected target cell activation on the equilibrium proviral load v*. Our model results show that for small values of τ, there is a sharp positive, rather than negative, correlation between τ and v*. As the value of τ is increased, we observe that the magnitude of the proviral load v* begins to level off before gradually decreasing and settling to a constant positive level for sufficiently large values of τ. Hence, viral expression is a factor that determines an infected individual's equilibrium proviral load. This second point provides further support for a non-latent virus strategy.

<a id='ba23cbb8-df7a-46de-b52c-295d1a2c4b77'></a>

A traditional measure of viral success is the proviral load, and a higher proviral load is a better established infection. With this perspective, Fig. 3 can be thought of as reflecting a cost-benefit relationship for infected target cell activation that governs successful viral persistence: A rate of spontaneous viral expression that is too low is of little benefit to the virus as latency does not propagate the spread of infection; meanwhile, one that is too high could also be detrimental as it over-exposes proviral cells to host immunity and places a stronger demand on the virus to replicate

fast enough to outpace CTL-mediated lysis. Our results suggest that an intermediate rate of spontaneous infected T-cell activation, for example in the vicinity of the peak of the graph in Fig. 3, could be optimal for HTLV-I to successfully establish and maintain a high proviral load in the presence of host immunity. This observation supports the theoretical hypothesis by Asquith and Bangham (2008) that HTLV-I relies on a dynamic balance between viral latency and activation in order to persist indefinitely in the host: complete transcriptional latency is counter-productive to viral transmission and propagation of the infection, whereas full infected T-cell activation leaves too many proviral cells susceptible to immune-mediated lysis. Nevertheless, there may be another consequence of a higher rate of spontaneous viral protein expres- sion despite its association with lowering the magnitude of the proviral load, which comes to light by examining the activated fraction of infected cells.

<a id='577c5937-0d7c-4c60-9064-9df35334fbd8'></a>

5.1.2. *Tax/HBZ expression increases activated fraction of infected cells*
Model (1) allows us to consider the effect of spontaneous viral expression or activation, represented by the parameter τ, on the second measure of viral burden or detriment, the equilibrium proportion of proviral cells that are actively infected, y*/(u*+y*).
The result of numerical investigation of this dependence is shown in Fig. 4, where we observe that the net effect of a faster rate of spontaneous viral expression is a higher active proportion.
In addition, unlike the proviral load v*, which decreases when τ is sufficiently large, the active proportion of proviral cells is a monotonically increasing function of τ. The main implication of the result here is that the rate of spontaneous viral expression, τ, determines a characteristic ratio of latent versus activated infected cells at equilibrium, irrespective of the magnitude of the proviral load itself.

<a id='b7f64586-bc18-490d-bd3d-cb2ee5a1b91d'></a>

Our model predicts a relationship between the proviral load v* and the active proportion of infected cells y*/(u*+y*) which is consistent with the recent experimental results by Melamed et al. (2013), who demonstrated a negative correlation between the abundance of a given infected T-cell clone and the proportion of the respective clone that spontaneously expresses the provirus in HAM/TSP patients. Taken together, the results shown in Figs. 3 and 4 imply such a negative correlation, when the rate of spontaneous viral expression τ exceeds a threshold value (of about 0.03 day⁻¹ as in Fig. 3; see also Fig. B3 in Appendix B).

5.2. Evaluating CTL quality: what determines the strength of the HTLV-I-specific CTL response, and why is infection life-long?

<a id='b417a520-cb9f-4422-a8b9-ce1220173c76'></a>

In the previous section, we investigated the impact of sponta-
neous viral expression in our model to try and resolve the issue as
to why HTLV-I is not silent. We have discovered that a low level of
viral protein expression can offer tremendous benefits in terms of
viral propagation and success. In other words, the net effect of
viral activation is to drive chronic infection and aid the persistence
of HTLV-I. These observations in turn suggest a complex interac-
tion with the host immune response that we now explore in
further detail.

<a id='4f45aad4-1cc5-410e-bd15-95ab42772a75'></a>

5.2.1. CTL frequency ≠ CTL efficiency
It is well established that cellular immunity, driven by the selective expansion of anti-viral CTLs, is an important branch of the human immune system that aids in eliminating invading intracellular pathogens such as viruses (Parham, 2005). In the case of HTLV-I, virus-specific CTLs have been shown experimentally to be highly efficient at killing antigen-expressing proviral cells and are important determinants of an infected individual's proviral load (Asquith et al., 2005). Moreover, CTLs are thought to play a role in the development of HTLV-I-associated pathologies (Asquith and Bangham, 2000; Bangham et al., 1999; Jeffery et al., 1999), although there is conflicting speculation as to whether CTLs are protective or whether they contribute to disease progression (Biddison et al., 1997; Mosley and Bangham, 2009). It is therefore essential to investigate how CTLs affect the outcome of chronic HTLV-I infection.

The strength of the immune response against virally infected cells has traditionally been thought of as being directly related to the frequency or magnitude of virus-specific CTLs in the peripheral blood. In HTLV-I infection, large numbers of circulating anti-HTLV-I CTLs are often found in blood samples from HTLV-I seropositive individuals, whether or not malignant disease is present (Bangham, 2003; Biddison et al., 1997; Parker et al., 1992). Such an observation is somewhat unexpected as the vast majority of the proviral load is latent and therefore invisible to host immunity. Indeed, how is it possible for the CTL response to have any impact on the course of infection when most proviral cells are transcriptionally silent at any given time and are thus not even visible to immune surveillance? Asquith and Bangham (2008) hypothesise that since the expression of HTLV-I proteins is crucial for viral propagation, then by exerting selective pressure on the small proportion of

<a id='9b06ec3b-2c53-4cf7-8020-6aea7ff75300'></a>

This underlies an important issue that arises in experimental data on HTLV-I-infected individuals, which is identifying the aspects of cellular immunity that are responsible for controlling the proviral load during the chronic phase of infection. A natural question comes to mind: What determines CTL quality? Does the size of the CTL response influence its ability to reduce the proviral load?

<a id='0d5a6728-f8d4-4a65-bdcb-c121e59576f9'></a>

We again turn to our mathematical model (1) for some insights,
focussing on two specific factors commonly believed to impact the
proviral load of an infected individual: CTL frequency and CTL-
mediated lysis of antigen-expressing infected cells. In our model,
the equilibrium proviral load is given by v*. Moreover, the abundance
of CTLs is precisely z* and the rate at which CTLs eliminate activated
proviral cells is represented by the parameter ̸.

<a id='db48c408-7ce3-4331-a6ef-ac9a60541764'></a>

A few straightforward calculations in our model yield Theorem 5.1, which demonstrates that the proviral load is positively correlated with the level of CTLs at equilibrium and negatively correlated with the rate of CTL-mediated lysis. The proof may be found in Appendix A. What our result suggests is that the strength or efficacy of the CTL response with respect to controlling the proviral load is influenced by how fast the HTLV-I-specific CTL response can eliminate virus-infected target cells rather than how large the pool of such CTLs is. A significant implication of this result is that the traditional line of thinking that the strength of the anti-HTLV-I CTL response is equal to its size needs to be re-evaluated.

<a id='ba95de49-ec01-4dd0-9286-0c0ec6da05d5'></a>

**Theorem 5.1.** Assume that *R*₀ > 1. Then, the equilibrium proviral load *v*\* is an increasing function of *z*\*, but a decreasing function of *γ*.

<a id='8f80a28b-753e-45e0-acf3-1e160f3ed6de'></a>

Intuitively, one may expect that the more CTLs there are, the stronger the immune response, and thus the lower the proviral load. However, the notion that large numbers of CTLs can be associated with large numbers of virus-infected cells is not new, and has been observed in clinical data (Kubota et al., 2000; Nagai et al., 2001; Wodarz et al., 2001). Moreover, experiments have demonstrated that a fast rate of clearance of virus-expressing infected cells is associated with a reduced proviral load (Asquith et al., 2005).

<a id='1d1ae46f-7974-4efc-934f-568b4a96a4ed'></a>

Fig. 5 shows a positive correlation between the frequency of HTLV-I-specific CTLs and the proviral load in an HTLV-I seropositive individual. In Fig. 5(a), the experimental data by Nagai et al. (2001) measured the percentage of CTLs targeting the immunodominant viral Tax protein in the context of HLA-A2 which represented the bulk of the anti-HTLV-I CTL response, and the viral burden was measured in terms of the number of proviral cells per 100 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which is directly proportional to the number of CD4+ helper T-cells that are infected. Meanwhile, Fig. 5(b) plots the relationship between the number of CTLs z* at equilibrium and the proviral load v* in terms of the infected fraction of target cells as determined by our mathematical model (1). Although quantitative comparisons have not been done, our theoretical results agree qualitatively with the experimental data from Nagai et al. (2001).

Fig. 6 displays a negative correlation between the rate at which actively infected target cells expressing viral antigens are cleared by CD8ⁱ CTLs, and the proviral load. Asquith et al. (2005) reported their experimental measurements of anti-viral efficacy as the number of Taxⁱ cells cleared per day per CTL and its correlation with the proviral load in terms of PBMCs (Fig. 6(a)). As Tax is the immunodominant viral antigen targeted by CTLs, such a measure is directly related to the parameter γ in our model. In addition, the viral burden measured in terms of infected PBMCs corresponds

directly to the measure of the proviral load with respect to the CD4+ helper T-cell population, which is represented in our model by the quantity v*. We observe that the data from Asquith et al. (2005) are in qualitative agreement with Fig. 6(b), which shows how the equilibrium proviral load v* changes with respect to γ according to our mathematical model (1).

<a id='b7290bd2-8f6f-4d79-89ce-754c7218445a'></a>

Our model therefore supports the relatively recent idea that a large CTL response is not necessarily a strong one, and that CTL frequency is not a reliable measure of immune efficiency (Bangham, 2009; Bangham et al., 1999). In addition, our findings agree with previous mathematical modelling work by Nowak and Bangham (1996) and Wodarz et al. (2001) demonstrating how the CTL response to persistent viral infections such as HIV and HTLV-I can be inefficient at controlling the proviral load yet CTLs may exist in abundance.

This finding motivates the question: Why is there no cure for HTLV-I infection? Indeed, our results indicate that a fast rate of CTL- mediated lysis is effective at reducing the proviral load.

application of vaccines that boost the efficiency of CTL responses elicited by infected hosts has been unsuccessful at achieving complete elimination of the virus, and infection remains chronic (Bangham, 2000).

<a id='650c42e2-f24c-4178-aee1-1f10b24c7537'></a>

Using our mathematical model (1), we offer a possible explanation for this failure by examining the impact of CTL efficiency, encapsulated by the parameter γ, on the proportion of proviral cells that is activated, y*/(u*+y*). We observe from numerical investigations that for sufficiently large values of γ, further changes in γ have little effect on the active proportion of proviral cells (note that we can equally conclude from the results shown in Fig. 6(b) that, when this same value of γ is exceeded, there is little further reduction in the proviral load v*). Indeed, combining this result with our earlier finding that the rate of spontaneous viral expression τ displays a positive correlation with the active proportion of proviral cells yields Fig. 7, which illustrates that the quantity y*/(u*+y*) steadily increases with larger values of τ for fixed values of γ, whereas for fixed τ, an increase in γ has only a minimal impact on y*/(u*+y*) when γ is sufficiently large.

<a id='29c4f003-7324-43c1-aa95-79fe4e9685a5'></a>

The main implications of the above result are the following:
(1) an efficient CTL response fails to eradicate the infection because
it cannot eliminate the activated (i.e. 'aggressive') part of the infected
target cell population, and (2) a faster rate of proviral activation
which exposes more infected cells to immune surveillance makes it
more difficult for CTLs to achieve clearance of activated proviral cells.
These observations motivate a hypothesis relating to pathogenesis
which is discussed in the following section.

For fixed values of τ, when γ is sufficiently large, a further increase in γ has little effect on the Tax⁺/HBZ⁺ proportion of proviral cells, y*/(u*+y*). Therefore, even though efficient CTLs reduce the magnitude of the proviral load, they do not necessarily decrease the active (i.e. 'aggressive') proportion of proviral cells."

Although much experi-mental work has shed light on the way in which several key factors of the infection may be associated with clinical status, either AC or HAM/TSP patient, a clear determinant to distinguish between the two states is not yet known.

In the previous sections, our investigations of key factors including spontaneous activation of proviral cells, CTL frequency, and CTL efficiency have illuminated important properties of HTLV-I infection that help our understanding of viral persistence in the presence of chronically activated immune responses. In this section, we take our results one step further by interpreting the roles of these key parameters in the context of HTLV-I-associated disease. In particular, we propose a plausible hypothesis for the identification of disease status and suggest a possible mechanism for pathogenesis.

<a id='f775d856-027b-4c0e-8172-12d93c1e9ec5'></a>

### *5.3.1. A hypothesis for determining clinical status*

The The equilibrium proviral load is a major correlate of clinical status: a high proviral load is associated with HAM/TSP development, whilst a low proviral load is associated with asymptomatic carriage. However, it is known that the size of the proviral load does not, on its own, separate ACs from HAM/TSP patients. Indeed, there is broad overlap among the proviral loads of ACs and HAM/TSP patients, and a high proviral load is not a reliable determinant of disease status (Asquith and Bangham, 2007; Asquith et al., 2005).

<a id='fd8e4d35-e8ab-45a8-882f-99818cdbdcb3'></a>

We propose instead that the extent of activation of proviral cells, y*/(u*+y*), and not necessarily the absolute magnitude of the proviral load, v*, may be associated with the inflammatory disease, HAM/TSP. For example, there may be a threshold level for the activated proportion of infected target cells above which asymptomatic carriers develop disease, regardless of the size of the proviral load. This hypothesis for distinguishing between ACs and HAM/TSP patients is shown graphically in Fig. 8(a), where the proposed theoretical threshold for pathogenesis is represented by the thin, horizontal dotted line. Our hypothesis is consistent with previous experimental data showing that infected cells from HAM/ TSP patients expressed the Tax protein at higher levels than those from ACs (c.f. Fig. 2 from Asquith et al., 2005).

<a id='12e02e95-d7cd-4f75-937d-c54733dd25da'></a>

In chronic HTLV-I infection, it is well-documented that the
magnitude of the proviral load is not a direct reflection of the

<::chart::> Fig. 8. A hypothesis for classifying clinical status arising from our mathematical model (1) is that a high activated proportion of infected cells and not necessarily the size of the proviral load may be an important determinant of disease. In the above figures, the solid line and the dashed line correspond to two different individuals. The individual represented by the solid line is seen to have a lower activated proportion of infected cells, but a higher proviral load, than that of the individual represented by the dashed line. Furthermore, for sufficiently high rates of CTL-mediated lysis γ, the individual corresponding to the solid line has an active proportion of infected cells that lies below the theoretical threshold for disease manifestation and would therefore be classified as an asymptomatic carrier under our hypothesis, despite having a higher absolute magnitude of the proviral load than the individual corresponding to the dashed line. (a) The thin horizontal dotted line indicates a theoretical threshold for disease manifestation. (b) A high proviral load is neither necessary nor sufficient to identify the presence of disease. The figure contains two plots, (a) and (b).

extent of activation of proviral cells. Although generally a high proviral load is associated with disease progression, it is not uncommon for asymptomatic carriers to harbour proviral loads that are higher than those of symptomatic carriers (Asquith et al., 2005). The separation of clinical status based on the active proportion of infected target cells rather than the magnitude of the proviral load could potentially explain how infected individuals with a low proviral load could have HAM/TSP due to a high proportion of activated infected cells, or conversely, how those with a high proviral load could be asymptomatic due to a low proportion of activated infected cells. For a wide range of parameter values, our model exhibits behaviour that is consistent with experimental observations (c.f. Fig. 2(b) from Asquith and Bangham, 2008); that is, at a given rate of CTL lysis, the proviral load in ACs is lower than that in HAM/TSP patients (results not shown). However, due to the shape of the curve describing how the activated proportion of infected cells changes with the proviral load and because the proposed theoretical threshold for disease manifestation is not precisely known, our model can also exhibit the converse phenomenon in which the proviral load in an AC is greater than that of a HAM/TSP patient (for more details, we refer the reader to Figs. 3 and 4, as well as Fig. B3 in Appendix B). Indeed, such a scenario is possible in our model as highlighted in Fig. 8, where we have plotted the efficiency of the CTL response \u03b3 against the two different measures of viral detriment. Parameter values are selected that lie in the same range as those in Table 1. In Fig. 8(a), with respect to the activated proportion of proviral cells, the solid line lies below the threshold for pathogenesis for all sufficiently large values of \u03b3, and thus corresponds to asymptomatic clinical status, while the dashed line lies above the proposed threshold for all \u03b3 and would therefore represent a patient with HAM/TSP. Yet with respect to the proviral load v* as in Fig. 8(b), it is seen that for all values of \u03b3, the magnitude of v* for the AC (given by the solid line) is, in fact, higher than that for the HAM/TSP patient (given by the dashed line). Our model therefore allows for a consistent framework that could potentially account for the existence of this phenomenon if it were to occur. Further studies are needed to deduce better estimates for the position of the theoretical threshold for disease manifestation and determine if such a scenario is possible, i.e. can there exist two HTLV-I seropositive individuals with the same immune efficiency, one AC and one HAM/TSP patient, in which the proviral load of the AC is higher than that of the HAM/TSP patient?

<a id='d05ff02c-0628-46c6-a69f-a4b2c78102a6'></a>

5.3.2. Failure of HAM/TSP treatment
We have observed previously how increasing the rate of
CTL-mediated lysis y, which is a measure of CTL efficiency, is
effective in lowering the magnitude of the proviral load, but is
ineffective in reducing the activated proportion of infected target
cells. In terms of the efficiency of the CTL response, there is an
additional consequence of our hypothesis for identifying clinical
status. Taking another look at Fig. 8(a), we notice that it is possible
for chronically infected individuals to have less efficient CTLs (i.e. a
low value of γ) and still be asymptomatic because of having an
active proportion of infected cells that lies below the designated
threshold. Alternatively, it may also happen that chronically
infected individuals with very efficient CTLs (i.e. a high value of
γ) could be diagnosed with HAM/TSP due to an active proportion
of infected cells that lies above the proposed threshold.

<a id='1538a283-7152-4a8c-9d84-fef987c0cfad'></a>

The above observation has an implication for HAM/TSP treatments and could offer a possible explanation as to why a cure for the disease has been difficult to discover. Consider an infected individual with HAM/TSP who has a given immune efficiency γ, as indicated by the open circle in Fig. 9. The dashed line shows how the activated proportion of proviral cells of this individual (i.e. with all other parameters fixed) varies with different rates of CTL-mediated lysis. Suppose that treatment is administered that enhances the efficiency of the HTLV-I-specific CTL response, which although lowering the absolute magnitude of the proviral load v* does not significantly impact the proportion of proviral cells that are actively infected. The active proportion continues to lie above the threshold for pathogenesis and the individual remains with the inflammatory disease.

5.3.3. *Immune compromise is a possible though unlikely cause of disease*
An intriguing aspect of chronic HTLV-I infection is that only a small fraction of infected individuals develop the inflammatory disease, HAM/TSP, after a long asymptomatic clinical phase. It remains unresolved as to how or why disease may manifest over time during the chronic stage of infection. In the context of our hypothesis, if there does exist a threshold level for the activated proportion of infected target cells that distinguishes clinical status, how could it be possible for the active proportion to increase and eventually cross the proposed threshold?

a weakened state allows for the progression of disease. For instance, over time HTLV-I may disrupt the functionality of the immune system and render virus-specific CTLs ineffective at controlling viral replication, allowing the population of proviral cells to expand tremendously. The scenario is illustrated in Fig. 10, where we first consider an asymptomatic carrier with a given rate of CTL-mediated lysis γ, represented by the open circle. The solid black line shows how the active proportion of proviral cells varies with respect to immune efficiency γ and all other parameters fixed. It is reasonable to believe that as time progresses, the efficiency of the CTL response is compromised so that the value of γ becomes very small. In this case, the active proportion of the viral burden would increase and could end up above the threshold for pathogenesis, which is shown in Fig. 10 as an open square. The infected individual then develops HAM/TSP. However, it has been experimentally shown that chronic infection by HTLV-I is not associated with overt immuno-suppression (Asquith and Bangham, 2007); more or less normal T-cell functionality remains. If anything, the efficiency of a functional CTL response is thought to increase over time, rather than decrease, due to continued exposure and increased specificity towards target antigens (Parham, 2005). This explanation is therefore unlikely to describe the progression of HAM/TSP.

5.3.4. A plausible mechanism for pathogenesis
Although silencing the expression of viral proteins allows HTLV-I to evade immune selection, there is little benefit for proviral cells to be fully transcriptionally latent. Indeed, continued propagation of the infection requires that at least a small fraction of latently infected cells becomes spontaneously re-activated each day. As we have seen previously in Fig. 4, the rate of spontaneous infected T-cell activation, τ, displays a strict positive correlation with the active proportion of proviral cells, y*/(u*+y*). In terms of the development of the inflammatory disease, HAM/TSP, we offer a hypothesis that as time progresses, the active proportion of proviral cells may increase, and could eventually cross the threshold for pathogenesis, thus causing disease. One way that this could happen is that the rate τ of spontaneous expression of viral proteins, which in our model is treated as a constant, may in fact increase over time.

<a id='e2b4ffe9-a5e7-4017-997d-9cc59e837efb'></a>

A hypothetical situation is illustrated in Fig. 11. As before, we consider an asymptomatic carrier with a specified CTL efficiency γ. The position of this individual is given by the open circle on the graph, and the solid black curve on which the open circle lies is the way that the active proportion of proviral cells changes with respect to the rate of CTL-mediated lysis, γ, with all other parameters fixed. Suppose that over time, the rate of spontaneous infected target cell activation τ increases. The net effect, as expected, would be a general increase in the active proportion of infected cells. It is then possible that the proportion of actively infected cells reaches the threshold for pathogenesis, represented by the open square in Fig. 11, and manifestation of the inflamma- tory disease, HAM/TSP, occurs.

<a id='b26a462b-730b-44e7-b627-88d537d99bc1'></a>

However, it is known that the vast majority of chronically infected individuals do not develop HAM/TSP, and instead remain asymptomatic throughout their lifetime. Supposing our hypothesis on the threshold for pathogenesis is true, this suggests that either the proposed threshold for the activated proportion of proviral cells is much higher than that of most HTLV-I-infected individuals or that perhaps τ does not change significantly over the course of chronic infection. Nevertheless, it is not clear why the rate of spontaneous viral expression τ would increase over time. Indeed, this rate is thought to be characteristic to each individual and is determined by two primary factors that remain relatively constant over time: the HTLV-I genomic sequence, which is genetically stable, and the dominance of infected T-cell clones, each defined by a specific site of integration into the host DNA (Bangham et al., 2009; Gillet et al., 2011; Meekings et al., 2008). Further studies are needed to resolve these issues and test the validity of our hypothesis.

An upward arrow is drawn at x = 0.05, with text "Direction of increasing τ" indicating that increasing τ shifts the curves upwards. Fig. 11. Our mathematical model (1) suggests a plausible mechanism for the development of disease. An increase in viral protein expression over the course of chronic HTLV-I infection may eventually push the active proportion of proviral cells over the proposed threshold for pathogenesis.::>

## 6. Biological conclusions

In this paper, we have developed a theoretical framework that incorporates sufficient biological complexity to accurately describe the fundamental within-host dynamics of HTLV-I infection and, at the same time, is able to account for some of the idiosyncrasies frequently observed in HTLV-I experimental and clinical data. Specifically, we have investigated our mathematical model (1) in the context of several important questions regarding the persistence and pathogenesis of HTLV-I in order to gain some biologically meaningful insights into the nature of chronic HTLV-I infection. One key feature of our model that differs from previous models is the consideration of a dynamically changing within-host environment involving the complex interplay between infected target cells that may either be latent or activated, and persistent virus-specific host immune responses. Our study has shed light on the way in which HTLV-I interacts with host immunity to persist. The results of our model are consistent with experimental observations and, in addition, raise further questions that may be experimentally testable.

<a id='39f69300-dcf7-4739-b16c-04411f6dad38'></a>

In particular, we set out to illuminate the following three key questions in HTLV-I immunology:

<a id='311d1c88-9163-4f61-8d8a-7b7b66ac446c'></a>

Q1. Why is HTLV-I not silent?
*   Viral expression is necessary for the establishment, propagation, and persistence of HTLV-I infection.

Recently, Asquith et al. (2007) have given a definitive resolution to the issue of HTLV-I latency by demonstrating experimentally that HTLV-I is not a fully silent infection and that on-going viral transcription is present. We asked the question: Why is HTLV-I not silent since proviral activation exposes infected target cells to immune-mediated pressure?

We investigated this question in the context of our mathematical model, and discovered that for a completely latent virus, the benefits gained by activation aided in the establishment of infection. Moreover, the rate of spontaneous expression of viral antigens was shown to be an important determinant of the proviral load.

Q2. What determines the strength of the HTLV-I-specific CTL response, and why is infection life-long?
*   Efficient control of the HTLV-I proviral load depends on a high rate of CTL-mediated lysis and not on the frequency of anti-HTLV-I CTLs.

Our model has demonstrated that despite frequent viral latency, the HTLV-I-specific CTL response is a factor that determines the level of the proviral load at equilibrium. The ability of the CTL response to effectively control the proviral load may not be dependent upon the numbers of CTLs, but on how fast CTLs are able to lyse the relatively small proportion of virus-infected target cells that are activated. The results of our model agree qualitatively with experimental data from Nagai et al. (2001) and Asquith et al. (2005).

*   Infection may be life-long because efficient immune responses fail to eliminate the small proportion of proviral cells that are activated.

An efficient HTLV-I-specific CTL response kills virus-expressing actively infected cells at a rapid rate and lowers the proviral load. However, due to the benefits to the virus gained by exhibiting at least a low level of proviral expression, a plausible reason why efficient CTLs cannot eradicate the infection is because they are unable to completely eliminate the activated proportion of proviral cells that are aggressively propagating the infection. Furthermore, from our model, we have shown the somewhat non-intuitive result that a faster rate of spontaneous proviral activation and subsequent

<a id='9f8b2bab-eecb-48ed-9e6d-1c44784350ae'></a>

expression of HTLV-I antigens, which exposes more infected
target cells to host immunity, make it more challenging for
CTLs to achieve complete viral clearance of the actively
infected target cell pool.

<a id='d6b31722-dc03-4084-9849-35c3019e2f7d'></a>

Q3. What characterises HTLV-I-linked pathology?
▸ The extent of proviral activation rather than the size of the proviral load may distinguish clinical status and suggests a potential route for disease manifestation.

<a id='f51b37f6-7972-4f3d-893a-a1d1f04c5fad'></a>

Finding a quantifiable measure for the amount of detriment caused by HTLV-I is important in assessing the severity of infection and disease: For an asymptomatic carrier, what is the risk of developing disease? For a HAM/TSP patient, how far has the disease progressed?

<a id='7636c969-302b-400a-97df-31c4f854c5ab'></a>

A traditional measure of viral burden is the proviral load, which is a direct representation of the magnitude of the infection. However, the proviral load among both ACs and HAM/TSP patients can display large overlap and its magnitude alone cannot determine clinical status (Asquith et al., 2000; Mosley et al., 2005). We propose that the activated proportion of proviral cells could be an alternative measure of viral burden that distinguishes ACs from HAM/TSP patients, independent of the size of the proviral load. Namely, we hypothesise that a high level of infected target cell activation could be associated with HAM/TSP, whereas a low level of proviral activation may correspond to asymptomatic carriage—there exists a threshold level of activation separating the two states. Our results offer insights to two unknown issues in HTLV-I pathogenesis. (i) Why do HAM/TSP treatments fail to eradicate disease? and (ii) what causes the progression of HTLV-I infection from the asymptomatic stage to HAM/TSP?

<a id='86fce878-9179-4612-a30f-68ccc336a5fa'></a>

For the former, we have demonstrated using our math-
ematical model that treatments boosting the efficiency of
the HTLV-I-specific CTL response may be inadequate at
reducing the activated proportion of proviral cells below
the proposed threshold level for disease, despite being
effective at lowering the proviral load. For the latter, we
suggest a plausible mechanism for disease manifestation:
The rate of spontaneous viral activation increases over
time, for example through activation induced by pro-
stimulatory signalling pathways (Höllsberg et al., 1999),
gradually raising the proportion of infected target cells that
are activated and eventually crossing the proposed thresh-
old for disease.

all $t \geq 0$. It is clear that

$\frac{dx}{dt} \leq \lambda - \mu_1 x,$

<a id='65c044a2-8a2a-49da-b0d7-4ac5b0355c38'></a>

lim sup x(t) ≤ λ
t→∞ μ1

<a id='8dabd32f-4b37-46a1-b297-fedd150270a4'></a>

Adding the first three equations yields

d/dt(x+u+y) ≤ λ−(μ−r)(x+u+y),

<a id='f363f7ce-8a3d-4c3e-8dc9-aea7866f3a5b'></a>

where μ = min{μ₁, μ₂, μ₃}, which implies that lim supₜ→∞(x(t)+u(t) +y(t)) ≤ λ/(μ−r). The assumption that r < μ ensures that the quantity on the right-hand side of the inequality is always positive. For the last inequality, let (x(t), u(t), y(t), z(t)) be a solution of model (1) with x(0)+u(0)+y(0) ≤ λ/(μ−r). Then,

<a id='1447843b-57e9-41f8-a12a-9883296609a1'></a>

$$\frac{dz}{dt} = \nu y - \mu_4 Z \leq \nu \frac{\lambda}{\mu - r} - \mu_4 Z \implies \limsup_{t\to\infty} z(t) \leq \frac{\lambda\nu}{\mu_4(\mu - r)}$$

A.2. Proof of Theorem 3.2. Part 1: existence of equilibria

The first proposition shows that the basic reproduction number for viral infection, given by

$R_0 = \frac{\tau}{\mu_3(\tau+\mu_2)}(\beta x_H + r)$ where $x_H = \frac{\lambda}{\mu_1}$,

as in Eq. (2), determines the existence of equilibria in $\bar{T}$.

<a id='00fcfa53-9731-4ae7-a703-0b24c727882a'></a>

**Proposition A1** (Existence of equilibria).

(1) The infection-free equilibrium P₀ = (x_H, 0, 0, 0), where x_H = λ/μ₁, always exists in Γ. Moreover, if 0 < R₀ < 1, then P₀ is the only equilibrium in Γ.
(2) If R₀ > 1, then there exist exactly two equilibria, P₀ on ∂Γ and a unique chronic infection equilibrium P* = (x*, u*, y*, z*) in Γ.

<a id='c7d4c4f5-9a62-4b99-8ab9-49adc3fc3ff0'></a>

Proof. Equilibria occur when

0 = λ - βxy - μ₁x,

0 = βxy + ry - (τ + μ₂)u,

0 = τu - γyz - μ₃y,

0 = νy - μ₄z.

(A.1c)

(A.1d)

<a id='691effff-147f-45b6-bed7-14466f96238b'></a>

Observe that since *x*, *u*, *y*, *z* are restricted to be non-negative in the biologically feasible region Γ, then from Eqs. (A.1c) and (A.1d), *u* = 0 ⇔ *y* = 0 ⇔ *z* = 0 at equilibrium. There are only two possible non-negative equilibria in our model (1): P₀ representing the infection-free state, and P* representing chronic infection.

<a id='11e7c59d-7b5a-423a-a597-14a42da04ca0'></a>

We first determine the existence of the infection-free equilibrium P₀ = (x_H, 0, 0, 0), where x_H = λ/μ_1 is the level of target cells in the absence of an infection and coincides precisely with the normal CD4⁺ helper T-cell count in a healthy individual.

<a id='793d9487-5ec0-4cc0-b7de-fb6ea7eacc92'></a>

Next, we search for steady state solutions of the form
P* = (x*, u*, y*, z*), where x*, u*, y*, z* > 0. We will refer to such
a steady state, if it exists, as a _chronic infection_ equilibrium.
Eqs. (A.1a)-(A.1d) allow us to express x*, u*, and y* in terms of

<a id='8f415eb7-d64a-4ee1-a5f3-9bcce0722e05'></a>

z*. Namely,
x* = λν / (βμ4z* + νμ1), u* = μ4(γz* + μ3)z* / τν, y* = μ4z* / ν, (A.2)

<a id='b55eb19e-4b39-4120-853f-27722e4b011b'></a>

where z* is a root of the following function:

$F(z) = \frac{\tau}{\mu_3(\tau+\mu_2)} \left( \frac{\beta\lambda\nu}{\beta\mu_4z+\nu\mu_1} + r \right) - \frac{\gamma}{\mu_3}z - 1.$ (A.3)

<a id='bec846f8-ad47-4683-bcf3-dd5998260c1b'></a>

Clearly, F(z) is a monotonically decreasing function of z and
limz→∞ F(z) < 0. Moreover, since
F(0) = [R₀ - 1],

<a id='75800da5-546f-4190-835b-2d7002b05390'></a>

the existence of a unique positive root z* of F(z) = 0 is equivalent to the condition that R0 > 1, thus completing the proof.

A.3. Proof of _Theorem 3.2_. Part 2: stability of P₀

The Jacobian matrix for model (1) is

```
⎡ -βy - μ₁    0        -βx         0    ⎤
⎢ βy         -τ - μ₂   βx + r      0    ⎥
J(x, u, y, z) = ⎢ 0          τ        -γz - μ₃   -γγ  ⎥ (A.4)
⎣ 0          0        ν           -μ₄  ⎦
```

The local stability of P₀ is given by the following.

<a id='828b9cea-a89a-4b15-b589-db02b335949e'></a>

**Proposition A2** (Local stability of P~0~).

(i) When R~0~ < 1, the infection-free equilibrium P~0~ = (x~H~, 0, 0, 0), where x~H~ = λ/μ~1~, is always locally asymptotically stable in the feasible region Γ.
(ii) When R~0~ > 1, P~0~ is unstable. Specifically, P~0~ is a saddle with dim W~loc~^s^(P~0~) = 3 and dim W~loc~^u^(P~0~) = 1, where W~loc~^s^(P~0~), W~loc~^u^(P~0~) denote the local stable and unstable manifolds of P~0~, respectively.

<a id='4cb90bf9-df88-4bd5-b3d1-67163166893a'></a>

**Proof.** Establishing the local stability of the infection-free equilibrium P0 is equivalent to determining the signs of the real parts of the eigenvalues of J(P0), the Jacobian matrix at P0. The characteristic polynomial is

<a id='f0524e7a-3db2-458d-928c-0e96275f8633'></a>

χ₀(ζ) = (ζ+μ₁)(ζ+μ₄)[ζ² + (τ+μ₂+μ₃)ζ - μ₃(τ+μ₂)[R₀ - 1]],

<a id='2120bfd6-5e49-4e08-b379-c659677d891b'></a>

where R₀ is the basic reproduction number for viral infection defined in Eq. (2). The roots of χ₀(ζ) are precisely the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix J(P₀). They are given by ζᵢ ∈ ℂ such that χ₀(ζᵢ) = 0:

ζ₁ = -μ₁, ζ₂ = -μ₄,

and

<a id='08f35577-b675-4307-8be9-fa6e17fc0ad1'></a>

ξ₃,₄ = -½(τ + μ₂ + μ₃) ± ½√(τ + μ₂ + μ₃)² + 4μ₃(τ + μ₂)[R₀ - 1].

<a id='441d30d0-ce8e-4f5f-be27-70361b3e5fb1'></a>

Clearly, both ζ1, ζ2 < 0. Moreover, if R0 < 1, then Re(ζ3), Re(ζ4) < 0. Hence P0 is either a stable node or a stable spiral. However, if R0 > 1, it is readily seen that Re(ζ3) > 0, so that P0 is unstable. Specifically, P0 is a saddle whose local stable manifold Wlocs(P0) has dimension 3 and local unstable manifold Wlocu(P0) has dimension 1. If R0 = 1, ζ3 = 0 is a zero eigenvalue of J(P0) and no immediate conclusions about the local stability of P0 may be inferred. The preceding argument establishes the basic reproduction number for viral infection R0 as a threshold parameter that characterises the local stability of the infection-free equilibrium P0. □

In fact, a stronger statement can be made about the stability of $P_0$ when $R_0 < 1$, namely that it is globally asymptotically stable in the feasible region $\Gamma$.

**Proof.** Assume that $R_0 < 1$. Then by Proposition A1, the infection-free steady state $P_0$ is the only equilibrium point in $\bar{\Gamma}$. Note that $x \leq x_H$ for all $x \in \Gamma$.
Consider

<a id='52b59bf5-8248-4d30-a14f-ccf6686e5e20'></a>

L = L(x, u, y, z) = (x - x_H - x_H log \frac{x}{x_H}) + u + \frac{\tau + \mu_2}{\tau} y + \frac{\gamma(\tau + \mu_2)}{2\tau\nu} z^2.

<a id='5fd56025-12c2-48dc-ac4e-b2dea044d2d0'></a>

The function $L : \mathbb{R}^4_+ \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is positive definite, as

<a id='b8e1ffe6-6a60-4f2d-9174-1441d39c3944'></a>

(i) L(x_H, 0, 0, 0) = 0, i.e. L(P_0) = 0; and
(ii) L(x, u, y, z) > 0, for all (x, u, y, z) ∈ R⁴_+, (x, u, y, z) ≠ (x_H, 0, 0, 0).

<a id='d3f787a8-8a89-4f6c-823b-6cdc59deb186'></a>

The Lyapunov derivative of L is

dL/dt = (1 - x_H/x) dx/dt + du/dt + (τ+μ₂)/τ dy/dt + γ(τ+μ₂)/(τν) z dz/dt

= (1 - x_H/x)(λ - μ₁x) - βxy(1 - x_H/x)
+ (βxy + ry - (τ+μ₂)u) + (τ+μ₂)/τ (τυ - γyz - μ₃y)
+ γ(τ+μ₂)/(τν) z(νy - μ₄z).

<a id='6209848a-81aa-4f5f-8c68-eb52b08373bc'></a>

Replacing $\lambda = \mu_1 x_H$ and expanding terms yield

$\frac{dL}{dt} = -\frac{\mu_1}{x} (x-x_H)^2 + \frac{\mu_3}{\tau} (\tau+\mu_2)[R_0 - 1]y - \frac{\gamma \mu_4}{\tau \nu} (\tau+\mu_2)z^2$

$\le 0$, $\forall(x, u, y, z) \in \Gamma$ since $R_0 < 1$.

<a id='041e6155-46b6-4f7e-9c7d-807741b53939'></a>

Hence, _L_ is an appropriate Lyapunov function and moreover,
_d_L_/_d_t_(_x_H_, 0, 0, 0) = _L_(_x_H_, 0, 0, 0) = 0. Since the feasible region _Γ_ is
compact and invariant with respect to the vector field of model
(1), it then follows from LaSalle's (1976) invariance principle that
every trajectory starting in _Γ_ approaches a set _M_, where _M_ is the
largest invariant subset of

<a id='0323173a-d64a-4061-8ab0-f1e263550166'></a>

I = { (x,u,y,z) ∈ R⁴₁ : dL/dt (x,u,y,z) = 0 } ,

<a id='1544940d-031d-41b6-806d-44d2aa62fab5'></a>

which, in the present case, is precisely
{x = xH} ∩ {y = 0} ∩ {z = 0}.

<a id='9c7d84f3-e741-4809-8edf-f3e661e0d564'></a>

To establish the global stability of P0 when R0 < 1, it remains to show that the set M consists solely of the equilibrium point P0. Observe that in the set I, the variable u can take on any arbitrary value along the non-negative real line. Let ω(t') = (x(t'), u(t'), y(t'), z(t')) be any trajectory of model (1) starting in I, so that x(0) = xH, y(0) = 0, and z(0) = 0. Then, the behaviour of ω(t') at t' = 0 is governed by

<a id='0e0322be-b538-4ce0-9d99-f47fb7ff2a00'></a>

dx/dt = 0,
du/dt = -(τ + μ₂)u,
dy/dt = τu,
dz/dt = 0.

<a id='2c7d408a-6d98-4a91-ab09-d56942f56870'></a>

Hence, x(t') = x_H, Z(t') = 0, and
u(t') = u(0)e^(-(τ + μ_2)t').

The y-compartment varies according to dy/dt = τu(0) at time t' = 0. If u(0) ≠ 0, then dy/dt > 0, implying that y(t₀') ≠ 0 for some t₀' ≠ 0; that is, the trajectory will leave the set I. For the solution ω(t') to remain in I for all t', we must have u(0) = 0 and therefore u(t') ≡ 0. Subsequently, solving the initial value problem dy/dt = 0, y(0) = 0 yields y(t') ≡ 0. Taken all together, the above argument means that the maximal invariant set in I is comprised only of the single point P₀ = (x_H, 0, 0, 0), i.e. M = {P₀}. □

A.4. Proof of *Theorem 3.2*. Part 3: stability of P*

<a id='94d44a2a-eae8-45db-99b7-0bab16e421f3'></a>

The final part of the proof of Theorem 3.2 is to demonstrate the global stability of the chronic infection equilibrium P* whenever it exists in the Γ. We therefore establish the following.

<a id='ebf7a73e-9832-4510-adec-436630bd9b2a'></a>

**Proposition A4** (Global stability of P*). When R0 > 1, the chronic-infection equilibrium P* is globally asymptotically stable in Γ.

<a id='a6b01b23-ece3-4c12-a46d-4229b61edc8c'></a>

**Proof.** Assume that R_0 > 1. Then by Proposition A1, the chronic infection equilibrium P* exists in the feasible region Γ. To prove the result, we construct an appropriate Lyapunov function V: R_+^4 → R that will allow us to conclude the global asymptotic stability of P* in Γ.

<a id='ede91685-db15-4da6-8519-5c155ce3d717'></a>

Suppose that $(x(t), u(t), y(t), z(t))$ is a solution of model (1) and let
$V = (x - x^* - x^* \log \frac{x}{x^*}) + (u - u^* - u^* \log \frac{u}{u^*})$
$+ \frac{\tau + \mu_2}{\tau} (y - y^* - y^* \log \frac{y}{y^*}) + \frac{\gamma}{\tau \nu}(\tau + \mu_2)z^* (z - z^* - z^* \log \frac{z}{z^*}).$

<a id='a1fce8dd-90fd-4cec-a533-a81872daabd6'></a>

The function $V=V(x, u, y, z)$ is positive definite with respect to the chronic infection equilibrium point $P^* = (x^*, u^*, y^*, z^*)$. Taking the Lyapunov derivative along the solution $(x(t), u(t), y(t), z(t))$ yields

$\frac{dV}{dt} = \left(1-\frac{x^*}{x}\right) \frac{dx}{dt} + \left(1-\frac{u^*}{u}\right) \frac{du}{dt} + \frac{\tau+\mu_2}{\tau} \left(1-\frac{y^*}{y}\right) \frac{dy}{dt}$

$+ \frac{\gamma}{\tau\nu}(\tau+\mu_2)z^* \left(1-\frac{z^*}{z}\right) \frac{dz}{dt}$

$= \left(1-\frac{x^*}{x}\right)(\lambda-\beta xy-\mu_1 x) + \left(1-\frac{u^*}{u}\right)(\beta xy+ry-(\tau+\mu_2)u)$

$+ \frac{\tau+\mu_2}{\tau} \left(1-\frac{y^*}{y}\right)(\tau u-\gamma yz-\mu_3 y)$

$+ \frac{\gamma}{\tau\nu}(\tau+\mu_2)z^* \left(1-\frac{z^*}{z}\right)(\nu y-\mu_4 z).$

<a id='c43655d3-3874-4984-ace1-8f728f9c8091'></a>

By making the appropriate substitutions using the equilibrium
equations (A.1a)-(A.1d), we find that

dV/dt = (1 - x*/x)(μ1x* - μ1x) + (1 - x*/x)(βx*y* - βxy)

+ (1 - u*/u)(βxy + ry - (βx*y* + ry*)u*/u)

+ (βx*y* + ry*)/(τu*)(1 - y*/y)(τu - τu*y/y*)

+ (τ + μ2)/τ(1 - y*/y)(γyz* - γyz)

+ γ/(τν)(τ + μ2)z*(1 - z*/z)(νy - νy*z/z*)

= μ1x*(2 - x*/x - x/x*) + βx*y*(3 - x*/x - xu*y/u*y*)

+ ry*(2 - u*y/u y* - u/u*) + γ/τ(τ + μ2)yz*(2 - z/z* - z*/z) ≤ 0.

<a id='8f36fd30-4c84-4898-868c-54567e10bfa8'></a>

The final line follows from the inequalities $\sqrt{a_1a_2} \leq (a_1+a_2)/2$ and $\sqrt[3]{a_1a_2a_3} \leq (a_1+a_2+a_3)/3$, where $a_1, a_2, a_3 > 0$; that is, the geometric mean of $n$ positive numbers can be no greater than their arithmetic mean. Hence, the global stability of $P^*$ has been established when $R_0 > 1$. □

<a id='6e3d72d3-aa71-44db-b2fa-d8c86404b7fc'></a>

A.5. Proof of *Theorem 5.1*

Consider the proviral load at equilibrium, $v^* = (u^*+y^*)/(x^*+u^*+y^*)$. From Eq. (A.2), we have

$u^*+y^* = \frac{\mu_4}{\tau\nu}(\gamma z^*+\tau+\mu_3)z^*$ and $x^* = \frac{\lambda\nu}{\beta\mu_4 z^*+\nu\mu_1}$

To show the first part of the theorem, we compute
d/dz*(u*+y*) = μ₄/τν(2γz* +τ+μ₃) > 0,

<a id='b85baebc-4df2-4a76-8e79-1eb45c622074'></a>

Then,

dv*

<a id='dc2853a4-2363-4f3b-b5c7-beb4969eb0ec'></a>

Hence, the proviral load at equilibrium, v*, is an increasing function of z*.
The second part of the theorem is proved by observing that

dv*/dy = dv*/dz* * dz*/dy

It can be straight-forwardly shown that dz*/dy < 0, whose derivation follows directly from differentiating the equation F(z*) = 0, where F (z) is defined in Eq. (A.3), implicitly with respect to the parameter γ. Combined with the result from the first part of the theorem demonstrating that dv*/dz* > 0, we therefore conclude that

dv*/dy < 0;

that is, v* is a decreasing function of γ.

Fig. B1. Time series plots for each of the T-cell populations under investigation comparing exponential and logistic growth terms for infected target cell proliferation. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure caption, the reader is referred to the web version of this paper.). For the latter case, the carrying capacity k has been selected so that x+u+y is of the order k. Specifically, k=800 cells/mm³. Because the rate r of infected target cell proliferation differentially influences each of the two models, we therefore explored its impact on the various cell populations. We found that when the value of r was chosen in the physiologically relevant range as in Table 1, the two models converged to equilibria that were close to each other. In Figs. B1 and B2, we plotted the time evolution graphs with a value of r that is two orders of magnitude higher than in Table 1. We observe, as expected, that although the effect of a logistic growth term serves to control the magnitude of the infected cell populations and hence the proviral load, there is no qualitative difference in dynamical behaviour. All other parameters have been chosen as in Table 1 and are the same between the two models. (a) Model with exponential growth term (large r) and (b) model with logistic growth term (large r).

<::chart: Fig. B3. Bifurcation diagram relating proviral load v* and the active proportion of infected cells y*/(u*+y*). The results of our model are consistent with experimental and clinical observations, and can even account for some of the peculiarities of HTLV-I infection. In particular, it is known that although the magnitude of the proviral load of an HTLV-I seropositive individual is correlated with the presence of disease, there exists a broad overlap in the magnitudes of the proviral loads among ACs and HAM/TSP patients, and a high proviral load is neither necessary nor sufficient for the progression of HTLV-I-associated disease. Here, the rate γ of CTL-mediated lysis is fixed. The thin, dotted vertical line representing the theoretical threshold for disease manifestation corresponds to the thin, dotted horizontal line in Fig. 8(a). The precise position of this theoretical threshold is unknown. (a) If the threshold for disease manifestation is sufficiently low, then the proviral load of an AC (along the curve to the left of the threshold, for example, at the position of the open circle) would always be lower than that of a HAM/TSP patient (along the curve to the right of the threshold, for example, at the position of the open square). This represents the typical case whereby a HAM/TSP patient harbours a higher proviral load than that of an AC. (b) However, if the threshold for disease manifestation is sufficiently high, then our model demonstrates the theoretical possibility for the proviral load of an AC (along the curve to the left of the threshold, for example, symbolised by an open circle) to be above that of a HAM/TSP patient (along the curve to the right of the threshold, for example, symbolised by an open square). 

(a) Proviral Load Versus Activated Proportion at Equilibrium chart. The x-axis is "Activated Proportion of Proviral Cells, y*/(u*+y*)" ranging from 0.00 to 0.30 in 0.05 increments. The y-axis is "Proviral Load, v*" ranging from 0.00 to 0.12 in 0.02 increments. A solid curve is plotted, starting near (0.03, 0.00), rising to a peak around (0.09, 0.115), and then decreasing to about (0.30, 0.07). The label "AC" is near the rising part of the curve. The label "HAM/TSP" is near the decreasing part of the curve. An open circle marker is at approximately (0.04, 0.035). An open square marker is at approximately (0.12, 0.11). A vertical dotted line is at x=0.045, labeled "The theoretical threshold for disease manifestation is not known". A horizontal dashed line is at y=0.07. A text box reads "The model predicts that the PVL remains above a certain level even when the active proportion becomes large" pointing to the right side of the curve.

The y-axis is "Proviral Load, v*" ranging from 0.00 to 0.12 in 0.02 increments. A solid curve is plotted, similar to (a), starting near (0.03, 0.00), rising to a peak around (0.09, 0.115), and then decreasing to about (0.30, 0.07). The label "AC" is near the rising part of the curve. The label "HAM/TSP" is near the decreasing part of the curve. An open circle marker is at approximately (0.08, 0.115).
