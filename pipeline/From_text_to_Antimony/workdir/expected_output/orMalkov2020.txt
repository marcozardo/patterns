  // Compartments and Species:
  compartment USA;

  species Infected in USA;

  // Assignment Rules:
  beta := gamma_*R_fixed;
  Fraction_infected := Infected/Total_population;

  // Reactions:
  Susceptible_to_Exposed: Susceptible => Exposed; USA*(beta*Susceptible*Infected/Total_population);
  Exposed_to_Infected: Exposed => Infected; USA*sigma*Exposed;
  Infected_to_Recovered: Infected => Recovered; USA*gamma_*Infected;
  Recovered_to_Susceptible__Reinfection: Recovered => Susceptible; USA*omega*Recovered;

  // Species initializations:
  Susceptible = Total_population - Recovered - Exposed - Infected;
  Susceptible has substance_per_volume;
