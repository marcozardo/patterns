/* Unmapped or ambiguous elements from the source (left as comments to avoid guessing):
- Full Model rate expressions (Eqs. 4?9) include auxiliary quantities (e.g., H_p_hat, H_F_hat, K_i^FH, possible product binding via ?) with exact algebraic forms detailed in Additional File 2. Due to OCR ambiguities and missing derivations, the present model uses the explicitly stated SKM1 (Eqs. 1?2 with Eqs. 10?11) and SKM2 (Eq. 12 with Eqs. 13?15) formulations, which the paper uses to dissect system behavior.
- Parameter ? in Eq. (3) of the Full Model and the precise coupling terms between the HIF and ARD modules (beyond SKM1/SKM2) are not reconstructed here.
- If desired, events can be added to program hypoxia/reoxygenation protocols by changing O2_tilde over time, but specific timings were not uniquely defined in the extracted text. */
