/* Unmapped/unspecified items from the source text (left as placeholders or not encoded to avoid guesswork):

- Exact numeric best-fit values for several parameters (kappa_0, c_kill, delta_I, alpha, delta_V, delta_T, chi_D, U0) are not fully specified in the provided text. Placeholders are used where needed to ensure the model loads. Replace with fitted values as available.
- Time-dependent dosing schedules uV(t) and uD(t): The text describes intratumoral OV injections on days 0, 2, 4 and DC injections on days 1, 3, 5 (for specific protocols), and other protocol permutations. Here, dosing is represented as source reactions with constant inputs uV and uD defaulting to 0. To emulate specific protocols, set uV and uD to time-dependent functions or implement events that toggle auxiliary dosing parameters which feed R_V_influx and R_D_influx.
- The original 6-variable model includes a naive T-cell pool A and parameters c_A, chi_A, delta_A; those components are omitted here per the minimal model (Eqs. (15)-(19)) supported by the paper?s reduction analysis.

Notes for use:
- Time unit assumed to be days; amounts/volumes arbitrary (e.g., mm^3 for U and I). Adjust parameter units consistently if different units are used.
- For OV-only protocols, set kappa_0 = 0, c_kill = 0, chi_D = 0, uD = 0.
- For DC-only protocols, set uV = 0 (and possibly beta = 0, alpha = 0, delta_V as appropriate).
- To simulate specific dosing schedules, users can supply uV(t) and uD(t) as time-varying parameters via simulator interfaces or implement events that adjust auxiliary dosing parameters entering the V and D influx reactions.
