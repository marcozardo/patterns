/*
This Antimony model represents the I??????B-NF-??????B signaling module as described
by Hoffmann et al. (2002). The model captures the core regulatory logic where
the transcription factor NF-??????B is controlled by three inhibitor isoforms: I??????B??????, I??????B??????, and I??????B??????.

The model is based on the following key principles from the paper:
1. Two functional classes of inhibitors: I??????B?????? acts as a fast, strong negative
   feedback regulator, driving oscillatory potential. I??????B?????? and I??????B?????? (lumped
   into a single species IKBbe) act as slower, damping elements that stabilize the response.
2. Compartmentalization: The model includes cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments,
   as translocation of NF-??????B and its inhibitors is central to the mechanism.
3. NF-??????B-induced Feedback: Nuclear NF-??????B activates the transcription of its
   own inhibitor, I??????B??????, creating the negative feedback loop.
4. Signal Transduction: An external stimulus (e.g., TNF??????) is represented by the
   activity of the IKK kinase, which triggers the degradation of I??????B proteins.

NOTE: The provided text describes the model structure and behavior qualitatively
but does not contain the specific mathematical equations or parameter values. Therefore,
the rate laws, parameter values, and initial conditions in this model are representative
placeholders designed to be consistent with the described biology and to make the
model executable. They are not the exact values from the original publication.
