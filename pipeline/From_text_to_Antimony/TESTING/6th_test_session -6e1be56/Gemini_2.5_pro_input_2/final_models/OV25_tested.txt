model Gevertz2020_MinimalModel_ViroImmunotherapy()

  /*
   * This model represents the "Minimal Model" of viro-immunotherapy for optimizing treatment protocols,
   * as described by Gevertz and Wares in Computational and Mathematical Methods in Medicine (2020).
   * The model simplifies a previous six-variable system to five variables by removing the naive T cell
   * population (A), based on sensitivity and sloppiness analyses.
   *
   * It describes the interaction between uninfected tumor cells (U), infected tumor cells (I),
   * oncolytic adenovirus (V), tumor-targeting T cells (T), and injected dendritic cells (D).
