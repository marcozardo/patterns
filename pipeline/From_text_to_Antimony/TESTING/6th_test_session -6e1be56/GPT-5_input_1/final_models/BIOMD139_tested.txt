/* Unmapped/unspecified details from the source text:
- Numerical parameter values (rate constants, transport rates, synthesis/degradation rates) were not provided; placeholder values are used to yield a runnable model.
- The original work considers ternary complexes (IKK?I?B?NF-?B), isoform-specific transport/localization rates, and distinct kinetic parameterizations; here we use simplified binary complexes and mass-action kinetics.
- Precise compartmental localization of mRNA (nuclear transcription and export) is simplified by placing mRNAs in Cytoplasm.
- The stimulus (TNF-?) to IKK activation cascade is abstracted as Events that toggle IKK_act; real signaling intermediates are not explicitly modeled.
Scientific domain: molecular/cellular signal transduction (NF-?B?I?B negative feedback module with nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling and gene regulation).
