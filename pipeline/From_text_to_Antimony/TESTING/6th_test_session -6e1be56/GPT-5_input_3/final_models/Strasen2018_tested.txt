/* Molecular domain: intracellular signaling (TGF-beta/SMAD pathway).
Topology extracted from Figure 4B and surrounding text: ligand (TGF?) binds/activates TGF?RI/TGF?RII at the plasma membrane; active receptor complex phosphorylates SMAD2, which forms a complex with SMAD4, translocates to the nucleus, and induces target gene expression including a negative feedback regulator (e.g., SMAD7). Receptor?ligand complexes internalize to endosomes and ligand is degraded, contributing to signal adaptation. Nuclear phosphatases dephosphorylate SMAD2 and facilitate export.
Kinetic forms and parameter values are not provided in the input; placeholders are declared below to enable simulation-ready syntax. */

/* Unmapped Data and Notes:
- No explicit numerical parameter values or initial ligand doses are provided in the input text. All kinetic parameters are declared and initialized to 0 (except Ki_FB and K_act set to 1 to avoid division by zero). To reproduce specific experiments (e.g., 1?100 pM ligand doses, restimulation times), set L_ext at t=0 (and via events) and assign nonzero rate constants based on the referenced BioModels (MODEL1712050001?MODEL17120500012).
- The feedback node (FB) corresponds to SMAD7 in the paper; additional negative feedbacks (e.g., PPM1A upregulation) are not explicitly parameterized here beyond generic dephosphorylation.
- Endosomal sorting, detailed receptor clustering, and alternative ligand?receptor binding sequences (e.g., L:R2 then R1 recruitment) are aggregated into a single effective binding step as depicted in the article?s pathway schematic.
