Abstract  
**Background:** The ubiquitin-proteasome system is responsible for homeostatic degradation of intact protein substrates as well as the elimination of damaged or misfolded proteins that might otherwise aggregate. During ageing there is a decline in proteasome activity and an increase in aggregated proteins. Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the presence of distinctive ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies in affected regions of the brain. These inclusions consist of insoluble, unfolded, ubiquitinated polypeptides that fail to be targeted and degraded by the proteasome. We are using a systems biology approach to try and determine the primary event in the decline in proteolytic capacity with age and whether there is in fact a vicious cycle of inhibition, with accumulating aggregates further inhibiting proteolysis, prompting accumulation of aggregates and so on. A stochastic model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has been developed using the Systems Biology Mark-up Language (SBML). Simulations are carried out on the BASIS (Biology of Ageing e-Science Integration and Simulation) system and the model output is compared to experimental data wherein levels of ubiquitin and ubiquitinated substrates are monitored in cultured cells under various conditions. The model can be used to predict the effects of different experimental procedures such as inhibition of the proteasome or shutting down the enzyme cascade responsible for ubiquitin conjugation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.151,t=0.462,r=0.844,b=0.705), with ID 9586d7d0-c3b7-4f3d-98c9-1adb4b46b7ad -->

**Results:** The model output shows good agreement with experimental data under a number of different conditions. However, our model predicts that monomeric ubiquitin pools are always depleted under conditions of proteasome inhibition, whereas experimental data show that monomeric pools were depleted in IMR-90 cells but not in ts20 cells, suggesting that cell lines vary in their ability to replenish ubiquitin pools and there is the need to incorporate ubiquitin turnover into the model. Sensitivity analysis of the model revealed which parameters have an important effect on protein turnover and aggregation kinetics. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.153,t=0.710,r=0.842,b=0.815), with ID 7eef874a-3506-4f42-ac0c-662e6f37f9e7 -->

**Conclusion:** We have developed a model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system using an iterative approach of model building and validation against experimental data. Using SBML to encode the model ensures that it can be easily modified and extended as more data become available. Important aspects to be included in subsequent models are details of ubiquitin turnover, models of autophagy, the inclusion of a pool of short-lived proteins and further details of the aggregation process. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.154,t=0.820,r=0.841,b=0.896), with ID 7e29afd9-e9b4-4894-bc81-8616bebf430e -->

**Background**
Ageing is due to the gradual accumulation of unrepaired random molecular faults, which leads to an increased fraction of damaged cells and eventually to the functional impairment of older tissues and organs [reviewed in [1]]. Cellular components are continuously renewed by the processes of catabolism and resynthesis as they wear out or become damaged. However the mechanisms of renewal are not perfectly efficient and over time there may be an increase in damaged molecular structures. For example, there is an accumulation of incompletely degraded intralysosomal waste material, known as lipofuscin, in postmitotic cells [2]. In 2001, Terman proposed the "garbage catastrophe theory" of ageing [3] which states that the process of ageing may derive from imperfect clearance of oxidatively damaged, relatively indigestible material, the accumulation of which further hinders cellular catabolic and anabolic functions. Terman points out that this theory applies mainly to postmitotic cells and not to proliferating cells. This is supported by the evidence that tissues composed of postmitotic cells such as the heart and brain show the most pronounced age-related changes [4,5], whereas tissues with constantly proliferating cell populations such as the intestinal epithelium show only minor changes with age [6]. A possible reason for this difference is that during cell growth and division, most cellular constituents are renewed and there is a dilution of any undigested material. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.082,t=0.105,r=0.490,b=0.524), with ID d64b4c71-3bc2-4932-802d-715191cef186 -->

Terman mainly applied his theory to the lysosomal pathway of degradation. He suggested that lysosomes gradually accumulate lipofuscin and that the lipofuscin granules attract lysosomal enzymes which, however, fail to degrade the pigment. This leads to a shortage in lysosomal enzymes, resulting in a decrease in degradation by this pathway. However, the major pathway for the rapid degradation of proteins is the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Proteins need to be degraded either because they are short-lived e.g. key regulatory proteins or because they have become damaged and partially unfolded. Partially unfolded proteins have exposed hydrophobic surfaces and are liable to form aggregates. Molecular chaperones bind to the exposed surfaces and an attempt is made to refold the protein. If refolding is unsuccessful then chaperones assist in the removal of these proteins and so prevent their aggregation [7]. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.536,r=0.489,b=0.790), with ID a6ef2a4e-2645-46da-9f4a-c76604fd9f2a -->

Interestingly, proteasomes themselves are degraded by the
lysosomal system and there is evidence for cross-talk
between the two degradation pathways [8,9]. It has been
observed that there is a progressive decline in the overall
proteolytic capacity of the cell with age [10,11] resulting
in an accumulation of oxidized and cross-linked proteins
[12,13]. These observations have been linked to an
increase in free radicals with age [11]. However, there is <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.804,r=0.488,b=0.925), with ID 7cdfed82-a6e2-4713-a891-5ba189300746 -->

also evidence that free radicals do not increase with age
[14,15], suggesting that the observed increase in damaged
proteins may be a result of a decline in removal of damage
rather than an increase in the rate of damage itself. Pro-
teins that have been damaged by free radicals appear
resistant to proteolytic degradation and can act as inhibi-
tors of lysosomal hydrolases and proteasome activity [16].
The small aggregates which precede the formation of
mature amyloid fibres are particularly pathogenic in
many amyloid diseases [17]. Sitte et al[12] found a dra-
matic decline of proteasome activity, but not of proteas-
ome enzyme levels in nondividing human BJ fibroblasts
during hyperoxic ageing. Such a decline is not a cell cul-
ture artefact because it has been observed in many tissues
including cardiac and skeletal muscle, skin, lens and brain
(reviewed in [18]). Sitte et al[12] did not observe a
decrease in lysosomal activity with time in nondividing BJ
fibroblasts. However, both proteasome and lysosomal
activity decreased in proliferating BJ fibroblasts [13]. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.507,t=0.107,r=0.911,b=0.391), with ID f4d39689-ba45-4c8f-a0b3-b0663fcf1775 -->

It has been reported that aggregated protein directly
impairs the function of the ubiquitin-proteasome system
[19,20]. Another set of data indicates that aggregation
occurs when the capacity of the proteasome degradation
pathway is exceeded but no distinction could be drawn
between the possibility of increased substrate expression
or a decline in proteasome activity [21]. Therefore, it is not
clear whether aggregated protein directly impairs proteol-
ysis or whether its presence is a symptom of impaired pro-
teolysis. The issues of cause versus effect require further
investigation particularly in the role of ageing. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.507,t=0.403,r=0.911,b=0.568), with ID ab05160c-1a86-43cb-9824-171518a1a483 -->

Many neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by the
presence of distinctive ubiquitin-positive inclusion bodies
in affected regions of the brain. These inclusions consist of
insoluble, unfolded, ubiquitinated polypeptides that fail
to be targeted and degraded by the proteasome [22]. It has
been suggested that cells possess a protective mechanism
to sequester and isolate toxic misfolded cytoplasmic inter-
mediates by delivering them to ubiquitin-rich structures,
called aggresomes at the microtubule-organising centre
(MTOC) [21]. Nuclear inclusions may serve a similar
function, sequestering aggregation-prone polypeptides
into relatively inert higher-order complexes. It has been
demonstrated that misfolded proteins are less toxic to
cells capable of forming nuclear inclusions [23]. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.581,r=0.911,b=0.790), with ID 2eff85c5-7ed3-4cc8-bc68-e1789d40c4b6 -->

In order to be recognised and degraded by the 26S protea-
some, proteins must first be tagged with chains of four or
more ubiquitin molecules. Ubiquitin is a small protein
found in all eukaryotic organisms. Ubiquitination occurs
as a result of the sequential activity of three classes of
enzymes, E1 (ubiquitin activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin
conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin protein ligase).
In the first step, ubiquitin is activated through ATP hydrol- <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.804,r=0.911,b=0.924), with ID 194346f4-21ee-4204-a73b-64f13d65a32c -->

ysis mediated by an E1 enzyme. The activated ubiquitin is
then transferred to an E2 (ubiquitin conjugate) enzyme.
There are approximately 50 different E2 proteins in mam-
malian cells [24] that have limited substrate specificities.
E2 bound to ubiquitin then forms a complex with an E3
(ubiquitin ligase) enzyme. There are hundreds of E3 pro-
teins [24] specific for different substrates. Three classes of
E3 proteins have been identified: the HECT (homologous
to E6-AP C-terminus), the RING (really interesting new
gene) finger, and the U-box domain types (see review by
Robinson and Ardley [25]). The following describes the
action of a HECT E3. As well as binding to the E2-ubiqui-
tin complex, E3 binds to the protein which is to be
degraded. The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to
the substrate with the release of E2 and E3. At this stage
the protein is mono-ubiquitinated. Further ubiquitin is
then attached to form a chain by the further action of E1
and E2 enzymes. A ubiquitin chain of at least four ubiqui-
tin molecules has physical affinity for the proteasome and
delivers the substrate for degradation in an ATP-depend-
ent manner [26]. During degradation, the ubiquitin is
released for recycling and the protein is cleaved into short
peptides, which are then reduced to amino-acids by
cytosolic proteases. Note that for simplicity our model
ignores alternative mechanisms of chain assembly (conju-
gation of preassembled chains onto substrates etc., as dis-
cussed in [27], and does not require the activity of E4
enzymes, which for some substrates may promote chain
elongation [28]. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.082,t=0.105,r=0.490,b=0.538), with ID ea2ff498-5cdf-4f62-b51b-65695f25b66a -->

A large number of de-ubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are also found within all eukaryotic cells [29]. In addition to processing the primary pro-protein translation products of the ubiquitin genes DUBs may edit polyubiquitin chains on substrates and thereby prolong the half-life of such substrates by preventing the formation of threshold length chains required for proteasome binding. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.550,r=0.488,b=0.657), with ID afd11e94-f3a0-46ee-a1c5-580acd12d80f -->

A model of protein turnover and the role of the molecular
chaperone Hsp90 in maintaining protein homeostasis has
previously been developed [30]. This model contains a
pool of proteins in its correctly folded native state (repre-
sented by a species NatP). At any point in time, a native
protein can become misfolded with the rate of this reac-
tion depending on the level of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) within the cell (higher levels of ROS lead to an
increase in the rate of misfolding). The pool of misfolded
proteins is represented by a species MisP. There are three
possible outcomes for a misfolded protein. The first pos-
sibility is that a misfolded protein binds to Hsp90 and
once bound, it can either be refolded and return to the
pool of native protein or it may dissociate from Hsp90
and so remain in its misfolded state. Secondly, a mis-
folded protein may be degraded and so removed. Thirdly,
a misfolded protein may bind to another misfolded pro- <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.670,r=0.489,b=0.924), with ID b0b79e04-f102-42fd-ba21-061d2a0e1a3a -->

tein to form a small aggregate (or bind to a previously
formed aggregate). The model contains details of the reg-
ulation of Hsp90 through its interaction with Heat Shock
Factor-1 (HSF1). However, no detail is included of either
the degradation pathway or the process of aggregation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.106,r=0.911,b=0.183), with ID fb38846b-93cb-479a-b5e6-7f659deffa6c -->

The aim of this paper is to show that the model previously
used to simulate chaperone function can be extended to
model ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, incorporating
molecular details of this degradation system. We have also
sought to incorporate details of the aggregation process.
One approach would be to take the computer code for the
chaperone model and then extend the code. However, a
better approach is to build a new and separate model that
can be tested individually and then linked with the chap-
erone model. A network diagram of the ubiquitin-protea-
some model is given in Figure 1. Details of how the model
was built are given in the Methods section. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.195,r=0.911,b=0.374), with ID 4b4f00c9-61a5-4d59-bd38-86dd0275c842 -->

Results  
Normal conditions  
The model was simulated with the initial values and parameter values given in Tables 1 and 2 respectively. Since the model is stochastic, each simulation produces slightly different results even when starting with the same set of initial values and parameter values. Figure 2a shows the random fluctuations for two of the model species when simulations are repeated 100 times. The model predicts that the level of native protein remains fairly constant, with a mean value of 499.0 with some small fluctuations due to stochastic effects and the level of misfolded protein remains low with a mean of 5.8 misfolded proteins at any one time. The mean values were calculated over a five hour time period from 100 simulations. The model output for a range of species from a single simulation is shown in Figure 2b. Initially there is a very steep decline in monomeric ubiquitin corresponding to the pool of ubiquitin that binds to E1 and E2. The pool of free ubiquitin further declines as misfolded protein is ubiquitinated. When the system settles down after about two hours, the pool of ubiquitin conjugates is larger than the pool of monomeric ubiquitin which agrees with experimental data (Fig 2b(ii)). The fluctuations in the ubiquitin pools are mainly due to the fluctuations in the amount of ubiquitin bound to misfolded proteins including those bound at the proteasome due to the opposing reactions of ubiquitination and de-ubiquitination. Some of the variation is also caused by fluctuations in the amount of E1 bound to ubiquitin (see Fig 2b(iii)). We kept track of the number of degradation reactions and the length of ubiquitin chain at the time of degradation. We found that the number of degradation reactions increases with the length of chain (Fig 2b(iv)). Since the degradation rate does not depend on chain length, then the reason that misfolded <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.507,t=0.388,r=0.911,b=0.925), with ID f8c57dc8-dc93-4949-8958-8f3817b3f31a -->

Summary : This diagram illustrates two alternative pathways for the processing of a misfolded protein (MisP) tagged with a polyubiquitin (Ub) chain, showing direct proteasomal degradation versus deubiquitination and recycling.

Nodes :
  • MisP with polyubiquitin chain (vertical stack: MisP (blue oval) at top, followed by five Ub (green circles)).
  • Proteasome (grey ellipse).
  • MisP with polyubiquitin chain (identical to first node).
  • DUB (deubiquitinase, orange oval).
  • Free Ub (green circles, separated).
  • MisP with shorter polyubiquitin chain (fewer Ub circles).
  • Proteasome (grey ellipse, repeated).

Connectors :
  • First pathway: Arrow labeled "k47" from MisP-polyUb to Proteasome, indicating direct degradation.
  • Second pathway: Arrow labeled "k48" from MisP-polyUb to a branch point.
  • From branch: Arrow to DUB, which splits into two arrows—one to free Ub, one to MisP with shorter polyUb chain.
  • Arrow from MisP with shorter polyUb chain to Proteasome.

Layout :
  • Left-to-right sequence.
  • Two main branches: direct degradation (top), deubiquitination and recycling (bottom).
  • Branching occurs after initial MisP-polyUb state.

Analysis :
  • The diagram contrasts direct proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins with an alternative pathway where deubiquitinase (DUB) removes ubiquitin units, potentially allowing for protein recycling or altered degradation efficiency. The presence of two rate constants (k47, k48) suggests kinetic competition between these pathways. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.270,t=0.408,r=0.741,b=0.515), with ID e7f3c282-ff91-4cc0-a8ec-bf37320374d4 -->

  • MisP (oval, labeled "MisP", blue) — represents a misfolded protein.
  • Ub (multiple green circles labeled "Ub") — four ubiquitin molecules attached in a chain to MisP.
  • Proteasome (gray ellipse, labeled "Proteasome") — shown twice, once interacting with the substrate and once after degradation.
  • ATP (yellow oval, labeled "ATP") — energy source.
  • ADP (yellow oval, labeled "ADP") — product of ATP hydrolysis.
  • Degraded protein (curved blue fragments, labeled "Degraded protein") — final breakdown products.
  • Free Ub (green circles labeled "Ub") — released ubiquitin molecules.

Connectors :
  • Arrow from MisP-Ub4 complex to the right, labeled with "k_deg", indicating the degradation process.
  • Branch from ATP to ADP, indicating ATP hydrolysis during the process.
  • Arrow from the proteasome to the release of free Ub and degraded protein fragments.

Layout :
  • Left-to-right sequence: MisP-Ub4 complex and proteasome on the left, ATP/ADP below the arrow, resulting in free ubiquitin, proteasome, and degraded protein on the right.
  • ATP and ADP are shown as a side reaction accompanying the main degradation arrow.

Analysis :
  • The diagram depicts the ATP-dependent degradation of a polyubiquitinated misfolded protein by the proteasome.
  • Ubiquitin molecules are released intact, and the misfolded protein is broken down into fragments.
  • ATP hydrolysis (conversion to ADP) is required for the degradation process, as indicated by the arrow from ATP to ADP.
  • The process is unidirectional, with no feedback or recycling shown in this schematic. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.270,t=0.514,r=0.693,b=0.626), with ID 8be6afe3-484e-47ad-8a43-349940fb44df -->

Summary : This diagram illustrates the cellular pathways for the processing and fate of misfolded proteins (MisP), including aggregation, sequestration, ubiquitination, and degradation by the proteasome.

flowchart:
Nodes :
  • MisP (ellipse, cyan)
  • AggP (ellipse, purple)
  • SeqAggP (ellipse, purple with dotted fill)
  • Proteasome (ellipse, grey)
  • AggP (ellipse, purple, lower position)
  • MisP + Ub (ellipse, cyan and green, multiple stacked)
  • Ub (ellipse, green, multiple stacked)

Connectors :
  • MisP → AggP (arrow labeled k11)
  • AggP → MisP + Ub (arrow labeled k72)
  • AggP → SeqAggP (arrow labeled k71)
  • AggP → AggP (lower) (arrow labeled k41)
  • AggP → Proteasome (arrow labeled k42)
  • AggP (lower) → Proteasome (arrow, no label)

Layout :
  • Central node (AggP) with multiple outgoing arrows.
  • MisP nodes on the left, feeding into AggP.
  • MisP + Ub and Ub nodes on the right, as products of AggP.
  • SeqAggP below and left of AggP.
  • Two Proteasome nodes: one to the right of AggP, one below AggP (lower).
  • Arrows are unidirectional, indicating process flow.

Analysis :
  • The diagram shows that misfolded proteins (MisP) can aggregate to form AggP, which then has several possible fates: sequestration (SeqAggP), ubiquitination (MisP + Ub), or degradation by the proteasome.
  • The presence of multiple arrows from AggP indicates several competing pathways for aggregate processing.
  • Ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation are depicted as key routes for aggregate clearance.
  • The flowchart highlights the complexity and branching of protein quality control mechanisms in the cell. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.273,t=0.634,r=0.659,b=0.789), with ID ecb3b2c8-7240-4dd8-8bc8-f573ca68626c -->

to be degraded is that they spend more time physically
associated with the proteasome. Under normal condi-
tions, there is no formation of aggregates and so no inhi-
bition of the proteasome (Fig 2b(v),(vi)). The levels of
available unbound proteasomes fluctuate between 75 and
100, as a result of varying levels in bound polyubiquiti-
nated protein. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.480,r=0.488,b=0.627), with ID 85ab234b-e524-426a-96ec-897d7e0ed2d4 -->

We carried out a sensitivity analysis to see how changing each of the model parameters affects the simulation output. The only parameters which have a significant effect on the results when increased or decreased by an order of magnitude were k1, k2, k67, k68, and k69. Varying the parameter for protein synthesis, k1, affects the levels of native protein but only an increase in k1 has any affect on any of the other species. Increasing protein synthesis leads to a depletion in monomeric ubiquitin pools due to the increase pool of protein requiring degradation. An increase in the parameter for misfolding, k2, leads to an increase in misfolded protein, a decrease in native protein, all the ubiquitin ending up in conjugates and an increase in degradation. Conversely, a decrease in k2, leads to higher levels of native protein, more monomeric ubiquitin, less ubiquitin conjugates and less degradation. Increasing the parameter for binding of polyubiquitinated misfolded protein to the proteasome, k67, has no effect on the model output, but a decrease in k67 leads to a <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.641,r=0.488,b=0.924), with ID e3ce15df-10a8-406f-a0a6-ec23f47f5a9d -->

depletion in monomeric ubiquitin pools, an increase in
unbound polyubiquitinated misfolded protein and less
degradation. Increasing the parameter for the chain short-
ening of polyubiquitinated misfolded protein, k68, has
the same effect as decreasing k67. However, decreasing
k68 has little effect on model output except that nearly all
the degradation reactions are via the substrates with the
longest ubiquitin chain. Increasing the parameter for pro-
teasome activity, k69, leads to more degradation and less
ubiquitin conjugates, whereas decreasing k69 has the
opposite effect and also results in depletion of mono-
meric ubiquitin due to less recycling of ubiquitin. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.522,r=0.910,b=0.701), with ID 24411b1a-a21b-4c21-85d1-9b1eb08e2ac7 -->

*Proteasome inhibition*
We carried out an *in silico* experiment of inhibiting the proteasome by setting the parameter $k_{69} = 0$. The model predicts that there is initially a build up of ubiquitinated protein and that the pool of monomeric ubiquitin is depleted. The depletion of ubiquitin is followed by a steady rise in the level of misfolded protein (Fig 3a). Note that our experimental data invariably show a decline in monomeric ubiquitin in IMR90 cells but that the results are more variable in ts20 cells; in some experiments there is no evidence of depletion in monomeric ubiquitin in the ts20 cells (Fig 3b) This suggests that there is compensatory upregulation of ubiquitin in ts20 cells after proteasome inhibition. Currently our model assumes that the total <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.509,t=0.716,r=0.910,b=0.924), with ID f73bf79c-7176-46df-8cc4-c09c6f410ae3 -->

  • Aggregated protein species accumulate slowly and remain at low levels.

Analysis :
  • The model predicts a slow decline in native protein and a stabilisation of misfolded protein under normal conditions.
  • Ubiquitin and proteasome pools are maintained, indicating robust protein quality control.
  • Degradation reactions accumulate over time, with longer ubiquitin chains being less frequent.

  • Panel (vi): Proteasome decreases as ApgP_Proteasome increases.

# Western Blot :

## Bands & Lanes :
  • Lanes: U87MG, NIH3T3, IMR90, IMR90+PI, ts20 (34C), ts20+PI (34C), ts20 (42C), ts20+PI (42C).
  • Molecular weight markers: 175, 83, 62, 47.5, 32.5, 16.5, 6.5 kDa.
  • Ubiquitin detected as a smear/band at high molecular weights.
  • GAPDH detected as a loading control (single band at ~37 kDa).
  • Arrow indicates a specific band (possibly monomeric ubiquitin).

## Design Encodings :
  • Ubiquitin: broad smear, intensity varies by lane.
  • GAPDH: sharp, consistent band across all lanes.
  • Lanes with "+PI" indicate proteasome inhibitor treatment.
  • Lanes labeled "34C" and "42C" indicate temperature conditions.

# Analysis :
  • The line graphs show rapid and reciprocal changes in ubiquitin and its conjugates, especially in the first 2 hours, indicating dynamic ubiquitin cycling.
  • Proteasome and ApgP_Proteasome levels are inversely related over time.
  • The western blot reveals increased high-molecular-weight ubiquitin conjugates in lanes treated with proteasome inhibitor (PI), especially at 42C in ts20 cells, consistent with impaired proteasomal degradation.
  • GAPDH bands confirm equal loading.
  • Overall, the data support a model where proteasome inhibition or temperature-sensitive mutations lead to accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.288,t=0.103,r=0.711,b=0.684), with ID 0e603c7c-3706-459a-824f-845a934245a4 -->

(b) **Survey of ubiquitin pools in various cell lines.** Western blot analysis of cell extracts from U87MG, NIH-3T3, IMR90 and ts20 cells with an antibody raised against ubiquitin. The pool of conjugated ubiquitin (vertical line) was found to differ between cell lines with the highest levels detected in NIH-3T3 cells. Comparable levels of conjugated ubiquitin were detected in IMR90, U87MG and ts20 cells cultured at 34°C. ts20 cells cultured at 42°C for 3 hours had the least detectable levels of poly-ubiquitinated conjugates. Whereas a shift from monomeric (arrowhead) to conjugated ubiquitin (vertical line) was observed in IMR90 cells treated with proteasome inhibitor for 3 hours, no difference in the pool of monomeric ubiquitin was observed in ts20 cells treated with the inhibitor. The membrane was re-probed with an antibody directed against GAPDH which served as a loading control (boxed panel). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.694,r=0.912,b=0.905), with ID 9be61fd4-5f94-471d-8a37-8121f12d284d -->

pool of ubiquitin remains constant but the model can eas-
ily be extended to include detail of ubiquitin turnover
(Proctor, Tsirigotis, & Gray, in preparation). The model
predicts that the level of native protein is not affected, as
protein synthesis continues at the same rate and so
replaces any protein which becomes misfolded (Fig 3a).
Aggregated protein starts to form after five hours and there
is a low level of aggregates bound to proteasomes. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.107,r=0.488,b=0.228), with ID 3febc456-f0e0-46b6-8258-9f0f3bc5b2d2 -->

We also varied each of the parameters in turn to see which
parameters affect the kinetics of aggregation. We found
that apart from the parameters actually involved in the
aggregation steps ($k_{71}$, $k_{72}$, $k_{73}$, $k_{74}$), the only parameters
which affect aggregation are $k_1$, $k_2$, $k_3$ and $k_{61}$. Either an
increase in protein synthesis ($k_1$) or in the misfolding rate
($k_2$) leads to an increase in aggregated protein which in
turn leads to both an increase in sequestered aggregated
protein (SeqAggP) and binding of aggregated protein to
the proteasome (AggP_Proteasome). This is due to the
increase level of misfolded protein which can not be
degraded. On the other hand an increase in refolding ($k_3$)
leads to a reduction in aggregation. Increased refolding
could occur if there was an upregulation in molecular
chaperones. Increasing the rate of binding of E3 to mis-
folded protein ($k_{61}$) also reduces the level of aggregation
suggesting that, if a particular protein was involved in
aggregation, then overexpressing the relevant E3 for a mis-
folded protein could help to prevent the accumulation of
aggregates. However, aggregates are usually composed of
a variety of proteins, so this approach may not be feasible.
As expected, increasing the rate of aggregation by either
increasing $k_{71}$ or $k_{72}$ leads to more aggregation, and vary-
ing the parameters $k_{73}$ or $k_{74}$ changes the ratio of SeqAggP
to AggP_Proteasome. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.240,r=0.488,b=0.612), with ID 1c276fad-0ef2-4e86-a703-af51dc5d2825 -->

*Parameters which affect protein turnover*
By setting the rate of protein synthesis, $k_1$ to zero, we can see which parameters affect the protein half-life. Figure 4 shows that with the default parameters, the protein half- life in this model is about 10 hours. We both increased and decreased each of the model parameters in turn by an order of magnitude. We found that only three parameters have an effect on protein half-life: $k_2$, $k_{68}$ and $k_{69}$. The parameter for the protein misfolding reaction ($k_2$) is most sensitive with a ten-fold increase leading to a ten-fold decrease in protein half-life, and a ten-fold decrease lead- ing to a ten-fold increase in half-life (Fig 4 green lines). The parameter for proteasome activity ($k_{69}$) only has an effect when decreased, with a ten-fold decrease leading to a four-fold increase in protein half-life (Fig 4, red line). The reason that increasing $k_{69}$ has no effect is that we chose parameters so that under normal conditions protea- somes are working well below their maximum capacity.

*Shutting down E1 activity*  
The ts20 cell line is a Chinese hamster ovary line in which a temperature-sensitive mutation in E1 allows functional inactivation of this enzyme at the nonpermissive temperature [31]. Figure 5 shows the results of the wet-lab and in *silico* experiments wherein E1 activity is eliminated, and subsequent conjugation of ubiquitin precluded. When ts20 cells are cultured at 34°C and then subject to a temperature shift to 42°C, there is initially no decline in ubiquitin conjugates (Figure 5a, 30 minutes). Then after 1 to 2 hours, the conjugates start to disappear and there is a corresponding increase in the monomeric pool of ubiquitin. The model predicts that when E1 activity is stopped (at time = 0.5 hours), ubiquitin conjugates continue to increase for a further half hour and then they start to decline, with levels becoming low after 2 hours (from cessation of E1 activity) and disappearing completely after 3 hours as shown in Fig 5b. Lowering the rate of DUB activity ten-fold, slowed down the removal of ubiquitin conjugates, so that it took 2.5 hours, after cessation of E1 <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.507,t=0.625,r=0.911,b=0.925), with ID bd821065-4019-4d94-8f06-70f5ddb240b2 -->

Summary : This figure shows a Western blot analysis of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins and actin in cell lysates from ts20 cells incubated at 34°C or 42°C for various times, with or without proteasome inhibitor (PI).

western blot:
# Sample Conditions :
  • Lanes are labeled as follows (left to right): ts20 (34°C), +PI (34°C), 0.5h (42°C), 1h (42°C), 2h (42°C), 3h (42°C), 4h (42°C), 4h+PI (42°C).
  • PI indicates the presence of proteasome inhibitor.
  • Time points (0.5h to 4h) indicate duration at 42°C.

# Molecular Weight Markers :
  • Left side ladder labeled in kDa: 175, 83, 62, 47.5, 32.5, 25, 16.5, 6.5.

# Probed Proteins :
  • Upper panel: Ubiquitin (broad smear, high molecular weight).
  • Lower panel: Actin (single band, ~42 kDa, used as loading control).

# Band Patterns :
  • Ubiquitin: 
    – At 34°C (ts20), strong high-molecular-weight smear.
    – At 34°C (+PI), similar or slightly increased smear.
    – At 42°C (0.5h–4h), smear intensity decreases over time.
    – At 42°C (4h+PI), smear is restored/increased compared to 4h without PI.
  • Actin: 
    – Consistent single band across all lanes, indicating equal loading.

# Analysis :
  • Ubiquitin-conjugated proteins are abundant at 34°C and decrease over time at 42°C, suggesting enhanced degradation at higher temperature.
  • Proteasome inhibitor (PI) prevents loss of ubiquitin-conjugates at both temperatures, indicating proteasome-dependent degradation.
  • Actin levels remain constant, validating equal protein loading.
  • The data suggest that elevated temperature (42°C) accelerates proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in ts20 cells. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.208,t=0.109,r=0.799,b=0.477), with ID fd4cf733-b2ec-491a-a725-06f9052add2d -->

Summary : This figure presents two side-by-side line plots showing the temporal dynamics of three species—Free Ub, Total bound Ub, and Ub conjugates—over a 4-hour period, with the y-axis representing the number of molecules and the x-axis representing time in hours.

line plots:
# Title & Axes :
  • No explicit title shown.
  • X-axis: "Time (hours)", range 0 to 4, tick marks at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
  • Y-axis: "Number of molecules", range 0 to 500, tick marks at 0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500.

# Data Series :
  • Three series in each plot:
    – Free Ub (black line)
    – Total bound Ub (red line)
    – Ub conjugates (green dashed line)
  • Both plots show similar qualitative trends for each series.

# Design Encodings :
  • Free Ub: solid black line.
  • Total bound Ub: solid red line.
  • Ub conjugates: green dashed line.
  • Vertical dashed line at approximately t = 1 hour in both plots.
  • Legends present in both plots, upper right.

# Distribution & Trends :
  • Free Ub (black): Starts high (~500), decreases to a minimum near t = 1 hour, then increases back toward initial value by t = 4 hours.
  • Total bound Ub (red): Starts at 0, rises to a peak near t = 1 hour, then declines toward 0 by t = 4 hours.
  • Ub conjugates (green dashed): Starts at 0, rises to a peak after t = 1 hour, then declines toward 0 by t = 4 hours.
  • The timing and height of the peaks for Total bound Ub and Ub conjugates are slightly different between the two plots.

# Analysis :
  • Both plots illustrate a transient redistribution of Ub species: Free Ub is rapidly converted to bound forms, peaking at ~1 hour, then returns to the free state as bound forms decline.
  • The vertical dashed line at t = 1 hour likely marks a key event or intervention.
  • The right plot shows a slightly delayed and higher peak for both Total bound Ub and Ub conjugates compared to the left plot, suggesting a difference in kinetic parameters or experimental conditions between the two panels.
  • Overall, the system exhibits a reversible process with a temporary accumulation of bound and conjugated Ub. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.189,t=0.501,r=0.793,b=0.717), with ID a16e5ed1-7c2c-421a-a8d4-9a806718d45a -->

Shutting down E1 activity in ts20 cells. (a) Time course of conversion of conjugates into monomeric ubiquitin pool Western blot analysis of cell extracts from ts20 cells cultured either at 34°C or 42°C for the indicated time with an anti- body recognizing ubiquitin. The analysis revealed a detectable conversion of ubiquitin conjugates into monomeric ubiquitin in cells cultured at 42°C for 2 hours. Maintaining the cells at 42°C for an additional 1 or 2 hours did not significantly enhance the conversion of conjugates into the monomeric pool. The addition of proteasome inhibitor in the culture medium of cells cul- tured at 42°C blocked the conversion of poly-ubiquitinated conjugates and resulted in their enhanced detection. The mem- brane was re-probed with an actin specific antibody which served as a loading control (boxed panel).

All other parameters as in Tables 2 and 3. The simulations were repeated 100 times and the curves show the mean values. Ub conjugates includes all ubiquitinated misfolded protein both free and bound to the proteasome; total bound Ub includes ubiquitin bound to E1 and E2 enzymes in addition to ubiquitinated misfolded proteins.

Discussion
We have built a computer model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system using an iterative process of model-building and validation of the model against experimental data. The initial conditions and parameters for the model were chosen so that the model output fitted the experimental data under normal conditions. The model was then validated by mimicking the experimental conditions such as proteasome inhibition and shutting down E1 activity. For example, with our original choice of parameters our model predicted that if E1 activity is shut down, then there is an almost immediate conversion of ubiquitin conjugates to monomeric ubiquitin. However, experimental data show that this conversion takes about two hours (Fig 5a). Therefore, we adjusted the parameters to reduce the rates of the reactions involved in ubiquitination, de-ubiquitination and degradation until the model output fitted the experimental data. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.151,r=0.489,b=0.420), with ID 282658c8-61e4-4386-8513-8793e5843e5d -->

With this final set of parameters, the model output also agrees with experimental data under normal conditions and when the proteasome is inhibited. However, under conditions of proteasome inhibition our model only agrees with data for IMR-90 cells and not ts20 cells with respect to the pool of monomeric ubiquitin. IMR-90 cells are diploid fibroblast-like cells isolated from human fetal lung [32]; they are nontransformed and with prolonged culture will reach the Hayflick limit and undergo senescence. The ts20 cell line is an immortalized line derived from the E36 Chinese hamster ovary line [31]. Whereas cell lines were found to be variable with respect to ubiquitin content (Fig 3b) there did not seem to be a correlation between ubiquitin content and immortalization or oncogenic transformation (comparing the normal diploid IMR-90 to the human glioblastoma line U87MG, for example). It may be that the robust growth of transformed cells places demands on ubiquitin pools and that such cells have devised mechanisms to maintain or replenish their pools; if so the IMR-90 results may be a more accurate representation of normal ubiquitin homeostasis. In order to be able to use our model for different cell types (including transformed cells) it will be necessary to add detail of ubiquitin turnover instead of assuming a constant pool. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.432,r=0.488,b=0.804), with ID cdf06b42-5ec7-4498-87c5-c9232b969a20 -->

We carried out a sensitivity analysis to see which parameters affect the model output, not only under normal conditions but also under experimental conditions such as proteasome inhibition and shutting down E1 activity. Under normal conditions, pools of native protein were affected by changing the protein synthesis or misfolding rate, and pools of monomeric ubiquitin were affected by <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.818,r=0.488,b=0.925), with ID 5c79c188-8aad-4e24-b018-59b3212251c0 -->

changing the rate of polyubiquitinated misfolded binding
to the proteasome, the rate of chain shortening of poly-
ubiquitinated misfolded protein bound to proteasomes, or
the rate of proteasome activity. Under conditions of pro-
teasome inhibition, increasing the rate of either protein
synthesis or protein misfolding, or decreasing the rate of
either refolding or binding of misfolded proteins to E3 led
to an increase in protein aggregation (and vice versa).
These results suggest that the availability of chaperones
and E3 enzymes are important in maintaining protein
homeostasis. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.106,r=0.911,b=0.270), with ID eaa3d793-1b7d-457c-b09c-93bb17233aa9 -->

We also examined which parameters affect protein half-
life. The most important parameter in this respect was the
parameter for misfolding with a ten-fold increase/
decrease leading to a ten-fold decrease/increase in protein
half-life. Since the misfolding reaction can be driven by
the level of ROS in the cell, our model would predict a
similar outcome by changing ROS levels, with an increase
in ROS leading to higher misfolding and an increase in
degradation, consistent with current thought linking pro-
tein oxidation and ageing [33]. Our model predicts that a
ten-fold decrease in the rate of proteasome activity leads
to a four-fold increase in protein half-life but that an
increase in proteasome activity did not decrease protein
half-life. It has been suggested that since proteasome lev-
els can only increase slowly due to their slow assembly
time, that they must have residual capacity for degrading
proteins when cells are stressed [34]. Our model allows
for this residual capacity and explains why a ten-fold
increase in proteasome activity has no effect on protein
half-life. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.284,r=0.910,b=0.581), with ID bd249989-1099-46e3-a5a1-0ad0be83d404 -->

There are also many other modifications that we could make to the model. For example, we have assumed that E3 binds to misfolded protein in one simple step; however it is likely that when a native protein misfolds, the first step would be for a molecular chaperone (e.g. Hsp90) to bind to the exposed hydrophobic surface to prevent inappropriate interactions. We could easily add this detail by including the following steps: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.595,r=0.910,b=0.715), with ID a4f7a3d1-683c-4867-870b-98ee72215d27 -->

Similarly, we could include the possibility that chaper-
ones aid in delivery of ubiquitinated proteins to the pro-
teasome. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.509,t=0.789,r=0.909,b=0.833), with ID 7a87a859-9d8a-45c9-86dc-e2842cba89ff -->

Our model includes a HECT E3, but it would be easy to
adapt the model for other types of E3 enzymes. For exam-
ple if E3 is a RING ligase, then it has to be in complex with
E2 before it can bind to the misfolded protein. This could
be represented by the following reactions: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.509,t=0.849,r=0.909,b=0.923), with ID 95ba47e5-8ceb-4e06-bb63-7a3093ae9224 -->

Our model only includes one pool of long-lived proteins
and so far ignores the fact that the majority of proteasome
activity is involved in the turnover of short-lived regula-
tory proteins and also the elimination of incorrect newly-
synthesised proteins. It would make the model more real-
istic to include an additional pool of short-lived proteins
and this work is currently in progress. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.083,t=0.195,r=0.489,b=0.301), with ID 96e26cc3-9b82-4a31-b33a-147369b0f8f3 -->

We have so far restricted our models of protein turnover
to the ubiquitin-proteasome system; however work is cur-
rently in progress to develop other models of protein turn-
over. It will be important to incorporate models of
lysosomal pathways since studies suggest that protein
aggregates such as mutant huntingtin are removed by
autophagy [reviewed in [35]]. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.313,r=0.488,b=0.421), with ID 8d356e67-e1e2-4922-be63-6593a7168e89 -->

We have included the possibility of aggregated protein
inhibiting proteasomes. Another possible cause of protea-
some inhibition is via unaggregated damaged protein
which could also sequester proteasomes. It would be
fairly straight forward to add this extra detail to our cur-
rent model. By running simulations over long time peri-
ods, the models can then be used to see how proteasome
activity is affected by damaged and/or aggregated protein.
This would be more realistic, than simply setting the
parameter for proteasome activity to zero. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.431,r=0.488,b=0.584), with ID bcbe4b39-1aac-4e51-9d1f-cf3e096555af -->

Our model predicted that levels of native protein did not change when misfolded protein levels rise, but in reality we would not expect total protein levels to continually rise. This prediction was due to our assumption of a constant protein synthesis rate. We could later include detail of feedback mechanisms such as the unfolded protein response which downregulates translation when unfolded protein accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.595,r=0.487,b=0.730), with ID 0f4e2019-25d8-483a-b04f-e0db10fc16ea -->

We have encoded our model using SBML which not only allows for easy portability but also enables the model to be modified and extended in a very straight-forward way. The model is available on the BASIS website and can be freely accessed from the public repository, so that the interested reader can run simulations, make their own modifications, or download the SBML code. The BASIS website has a stochastic simulator and a database for storing models and simulation results. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.744,r=0.487,b=0.879), with ID 97bbdc2c-f26b-4983-8ca6-58e03f2c07b0 -->

versity, for example the role of mitochondria, the antioxi-
dant system, and DNA damage signalling pathways.
Methods to link models in an automated way are also
under development which will greatly facilitate the devel-
opment of integrated models. For example, our model of
the ubiquitin-proteasome system could be linked to a
model of the mitochondria. This would be very valuable
since neurodegeneration is not only associated with an
increase in aggregated protein but also an increase in dam-
aged mitochondrial DNA [36]. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.107,r=0.910,b=0.257), with ID f6ffecea-ac23-4caa-bf45-ee39a1082481 -->

Conclusion  
We have developed a model of the ubiquitin-proteasome system using an iterative approach of model building and validation against experimental data. We have used SBML to encode the model to ensure that it can be easily modified and extended as more data become available. Important aspects to be included in subsequent models are details of ubiquitin turnover, models of autophagy, the inclusion of a pool of short-lived proteins and further details of the aggregation process. The model and its extensions will be an invaluable aid to further our understanding of the cellular mechanisms involved in maintaining protein homeostasis and how it is disturbed during ageing. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.270,r=0.911,b=0.479), with ID ac3b4876-9913-4071-a466-5c022b8ea920 -->

Methods  
Experimental Procedures  
Cell culture  
U87MG human glioblastoma cells, NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts and IMR90 human fibroblasts were maintained in 5% CO₂ at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% of a 2:1 mixture of fetal bovine and donor bovine serum. ts20 cells harbouring a temperature sensitive E1 ubiquitin activating enzyme (a gift from Dr. Sergio Grinstein, University of Toronto) were maintained in 5% CO₂ at 34°C in DMEM as above. Inactivation of E1 was achieved by incubating the cells at 42°C for the indicated time. When proteasome inhibitor (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) was used, it was added to the culture medium 3 or 4 hours prior to harvesting the cells for western analysis at a final concentration of 50 μM. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.493,r=0.911,b=0.745), with ID 63702e73-f649-4244-88fc-74ac55117952 -->

Preparation of cell extracts for western blot analysis  
Cells were harvested in protein lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-  
HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma, St.  
Louis, Missouri, USA), 0.5 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol) con-  
taining the following protease and phosphates inhibitors:  
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (Sigma, St.  
Louis, Missouri, USA), aprotinin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mis-  
souri, USA), sodium fluoride (NaF), sodium pyrophos-  
phate (NaPPi) and N-ethylmaleimide. The cell extracts  
were sonicated and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 20 min-  
utes at 4°C to pellet cellular debris. The soluble fractions <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.759,r=0.910,b=0.924), with ID 0c923ab9-da30-4554-a1cf-2a28c5b15dfe -->

mined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad Labora-

cytoplasmic extracts were then resolved on a two-phase
SDS-polyacrylamide gel (15 and 8%) and electroblotted
onto a hybond C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech, Baie D'Urfé, Québec, Canada). The
membranes were autoclaved on a liquid cycle for 45 min-
utes to enhance the detection of poly-ubiquitinated pro-
teins, stained with Ponceau S (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri,

antibody. The proteins were visualized by a horseradish

*Antibodies*  
The rabbit polyclonal antibody used to detect ubiquitin was purchased from Dako. The mouse monoclonal antibodies recognizing actin and GAPDH were from Sigma (St. Louis, Missouri, USA) and Stressgen Bioreagents (Victoria, British Columbia) respectively. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.328,r=0.488,b=0.421), with ID 1645b4af-fea6-4145-9c8c-f3ceb91f6da0 -->

*The Model*  
The model was built by first drawing a diagram of the system (see Figure 1) and listing all the elements of the model and the interactions between them. We then specified the initial amount of each element, the rate laws and the values of the parameters. With this information, the model can be translated into computer code and simulated. To encode the model we used SBML shorthand [37] which can then be converted into the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML), a computer-readable format for representing biochemical models [38]. The model was imported into the BASIS (Biology of Ageing e-Science Integration and Simulation) system [39,40] and simulations were carried out using a stochastic simulator based on the Gillespie algorithm [41]. The SBML code is provided as supplementary material (see Additional file 1). The model is also in the public repository of BASIS (urn:basis.ncl:model:2215) and will soon be available from the Biomodels database [42,43]. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.432,r=0.489,b=0.717), with ID d7a526e1-87d9-49dd-bfc5-b6f5168185d1 -->

*Elements of the model*
It is first necessary to specify all the elements of the model and the interactions between the elements. Using the terminology of SBML, we refer to elements as "species" and interactions as "reactions". The species needed for the model are a pool of native proteins, misfolded proteins, ubiquitin, ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2), ubiquitin ligase (E3), de-ubiquitinating enzymes (DUB), proteasomes, ATP, ADP, AMP, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and complexes to represent binding of elements e.g. ubiquitinated protein. A full list of the species with their names, database terms and their initial amounts is shown in Table 1. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.729,r=0.489,b=0.924), with ID a05e5077-9df4-4390-827d-e24024c27c94 -->

*Interactions between elements of the model*  
In our previous model of the chaperone system [30], we included a single step for the degradation of misfolded proteins: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.105,r=0.912,b=0.169), with ID 2fd6dfd6-0914-44b3-b0cd-e46ed10126e5 -->

where MisP represents the pool of misfolded protein. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.509,t=0.211,r=0.882,b=0.229), with ID 503e6c20-1802-4197-9b03-74f85b55be3d -->

We now replace this single step with a more detailed rep-
resentation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.241,r=0.910,b=0.273), with ID 4d69364e-7eb8-4b04-bd88-e06b6fcfc117 -->

*Binding of E3 to misfolded protein*
The first step in the degradation pathway is that the substrate (in this case MisP) is bound to its specific ubiquitin ligase (E3). The binding of E3 to MisP produces a complex E3_MisP. This reaction is reversible and so we have two reactions as follows: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.286,r=0.911,b=0.376), with ID bca5014a-2f4a-4723-9626-149292188212 -->

$ \mathrm{E3} + \mathrm{MisP} \xrightleftharpoons[k_{61r}]{k_{61}} \mathrm{E3\_MisP} $ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.510,t=0.396,r=0.704,b=0.441), with ID 098d499e-7f6f-4d65-8510-e80df10bd8c2 -->

We use mass action stochastic kinetics for the rate laws
[37]. The binding reaction is a second-order reaction since
there are two reactants and is given by $k_{61}<\#E3><\#MisP>$,
where # denotes the number of molecules. The disassoci-
ation reaction is a first-order reaction and is given by
$k_{61r}<\#E3\_MisP>$. The values for $k_{61}$ and $k_{61r}$ can be esti-
mated from knowledge of the protein half-life and the
steady state level of protein in its misfolded state. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.452,r=0.911,b=0.571), with ID 099aff37-d0d8-4d13-8f59-01ad9f6f6ade -->

*Action of ubiquitin enzymes, E1 and E2 leading to first ubiquitination event*
Before a substrate can be ubiquitinated, ubiquitin must be activated by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). This reaction requires one molecule of ATP. The binding of E1 to ubiquitin (Ub) produces a complex which we denote by E1_Ub: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.584,r=0.911,b=0.690), with ID d7d87ea3-e6b1-4826-b8d6-486cb2662339 -->

$ \mathrm{E1} + \mathrm{Ub} + \mathrm{ATP} \xrightarrow{k_{62}} \mathrm{E1\_Ub} + \mathrm{AMP} $ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.511,t=0.710,r=0.766,b=0.729), with ID 4f4e620c-fec9-470c-9651-58087ba613d9 -->

The activated ubiquitin is then transferred to the ubiqui-
tin-conjugating enzyme (E2) which releases E1 making it
available for further ubiquitin-activating reactions: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.509,t=0.735,r=0.910,b=0.780), with ID cc155a57-e351-4c2c-b174-56785833230b -->

$ \text{E2} + \text{E1\_Ub} \xrightarrow{k_{63}} \text{E2\_Ub} + \text{E1} $

Although it is possible that this reaction is reversible, it seems unlikely that E2 would return the Ub to E1. So we assume that the reverse reaction is negligible and do not include it in the model. Ubiquitin bound to E2 is then transferred to the misfolded protein bound to E3, releasing E2 and E3: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.509,t=0.801,r=0.910,b=0.915), with ID 85140354-0a55-47a9-8053-3c1a814ce110 -->

*Extending the ubiquitin chain*  
Further ubiquitin is then attached to the monoubiquitinated protein via the action of E2. Since each ubiquitin molecule must be activated by E1 before being transferred to E2, each step in the formation of polyubiquitin chain uses one molecule of ATP. The extension of the ubiquitin chain is modelled by the following set of reactions: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.153,r=0.487,b=0.259), with ID 291309a2-48cb-4d7c-94dc-0a2c84dbbc60 -->

$ \text{MisP\_Ub}(i) + \text{E2\_Ub} \xrightarrow{k_{65}} \text{MisP\_Ub}(i+1) + \text{E2} \quad (i = 2, \ldots, 7) $

Each of the above reactions is reversible, with the reversible reactions requiring the activity of a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB). We assume that the shortening of ubiquitin chains by DUBs is a step-wise process, although we could later modify the model to allow whole chains to be removed if it becomes of interest to model this. The step-wise removal of ubiquitin is modelled by the following reactions: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.275,r=0.488,b=0.437), with ID ef76aee6-c8d8-4350-8a38-0471f12fa59c -->

*Binding to the proteasome and degradation*  
We assume that ubiquitinated protein first binds to the proteasome and waits for degradation and that it can remain bound so long as at least 4 ubiquitin sub-units are attached. This can be modelled by the following reactions: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.483,r=0.486,b=0.559), with ID 7ac24e2a-767e-438a-9599-36eb99d96c22 -->

Bound ubiquitinated protein can also be de-ubiquitinated
in a step-wise process, so that proteins with longer chains
stay longer at the proteasome. This is modelled by the fol-
lowing set of reactions: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.647,r=0.486,b=0.708), with ID 22ec5aac-9a46-4cd2-a1c6-59c598bd4163 -->

When a bound protein has a chain shorter than four, then it dissociates from the proteasome. This is shown in the following reaction: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.086,t=0.752,r=0.486,b=0.799), with ID eee5c7a5-c638-4392-ae4c-39e2b303bef2 -->

*Protein synthesis and refolding*  
This model can either be combined with the chaperone model [30] or can be explored as a separate module. In order to investigate how the various parameters and species amounts affect the model predictions for the rate of protein turnover, we first carried out simulations on the separate module. In order to do this we added the reactions of protein synthesis, protein misfolding and protein refolding to the model: <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.106,r=0.911,b=0.242), with ID 0e8e6c2a-0437-480c-b116-37e2cd130eab -->

$ \xrightarrow{k_1} \mathrm{NatP}, $

$\mathrm{NatP} + \mathrm{ROS} \xrightarrow{k_2} \mathrm{MisP} + \mathrm{ROS},$

$\mathrm{MisP} \xrightarrow{k_3} \mathrm{NatP}.$ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.512,t=0.257,r=0.730,b=0.327), with ID 7264c522-9488-4308-acbe-38a66e4442aa -->

The rate of misfolding depends on the level of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) within the cell. We have omitted
details of the chaperone activity, where a misfolded pro-
tein would bind to Hsp90 before refolding can take place.
However, when we combine the models, this simple reac-
tion will be replaced with the more detailed reactions
given in Proctor et al., [30]. In this model, we assume that
ROS takes a constant value throughout the simulation but
we can look at the effect of varying the amount of ROS. It
would also be simple to add reactions for the generation
and removal of ROS which would then make it possible
to examine the effects of increasing ROS over time. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.509,t=0.331,r=0.910,b=0.509), with ID 8097f36c-8cad-44f8-b8fa-829349b4abc5 -->

*Protein aggregation*
If a misfolded protein is not removed immediately by refolding or degradation, then there is a chance that it will interact with another misfolded protein to form a small aggregate, or it may interact with an existing aggregate to form a larger aggregate. (Here we will not be concerned with the size of aggregates – a more detailed model is in preparation). An aggregate may be sequestered to prevent it interfering with the cellular machinery or it may bind to the proteasome. We include enough detail to be able to examine whether an increase in misfolding (for example by an increase in levels of ROS) leads to an increase in aggregation and inhibition of the proteasome which in turn leads to an even greater level of aggregated protein. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.524,r=0.910,b=0.732), with ID a01b8252-941a-41e2-a063-7baa2e24e86d -->

nated misfolded protein may also form aggregates but this

ited. As there are many ways in which misfolded proteins

*Setting the initial amounts of the species and parameter values*
Before the model can be simulated, it is necessary to specify the initial amounts of each species and the parameter values. There is experimental data on levels of ubiquitin and proteasomes in human cells. For example, Haas et al. [44] measured levels of monomeric ubiquitin and conjugated ubiquitin in IMR-90 cells giving values of 71.5 pmol/10^6 cells and 61.1 pmol/10^6 cells respectively. From this we can calculate that there are approximately 10^7 ubiquitin molecules per cell (estimated at between 1 and 10% of total protein molecules). Since we are only modelling part of the total cellular protein, we have scaled down the level of ubiquitin to 500 molecules per cell. The total level of proteasomes per cell has been estimated to be 8 × 10^5 per cell in L929 cells [34] which gives a ratio of about one proteasome to every 10 ubiquitin molecules. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.435,r=0.488,b=0.689), with ID 3ecb4921-dc0d-4832-b060-600d1cc83c1b -->

Since ubiquitin has many other functions apart from the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, the ratio of proteasomes to ubiquitin must be less than 1:10 and so we assumed a ratio of 1:5. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.507,t=0.105,r=0.911,b=0.167), with ID 0e8b0e65-df88-4219-9f32-a730c913dd56 -->

The level of E1 has been measured in IMR90 cells by west-
ern analysis of cell lysate compared to recombinant pro-
tein (Tsirigotis and Gray, unpublished data) and is
estimated to be 1 million molecules per cell. This is one
order less than the level of ubiquitin and so we chose an
initial amount of 100 for E1. We do not have data for E2
or E3 enzymes but for the sake of building the model
assume that for specific substrates these would be present
at roughly the same abundance as E1. We do not have any
experimental data for the abundance of DUBs within cells
but assume that these are less abundant than ubiquitin
and set the initial amount to 200. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.507,t=0.180,r=0.912,b=0.360), with ID c5a3e501-0c9f-4f3b-949a-fd9c492f8a09 -->

The level of native protein, NatP, was set at 500 and at this
level the ratio of native protein to ubiquitin and proteas-
omes enabled efficient degradation to take place. If we
increased the level of NatP to 5000, then it was also nec-
essary to increase the pool of ubiquitin and proteasomes
to prevent depletion of monomeric ubiquitin under nor-
mal conditions. The levels of ATP, ADP and AMP were set
at a fairly arbitrary level of 10000, 1000 and 1000 respec-
tively and the levels were kept constant by imposing a
boundary condition to these species. We chose to do this
instead of allowing the levels to fluctuate as cells posses
mechanisms to maintain ATP levels at fairly constant lev-
els and it is unlikely that the ubiquitin-proteasome system
would cause major changes to levels of these molecules.
ROS levels were set at an arbitrary value of 10 and the level
remained constant as there are no mechanisms in this
model that would cause ROS levels to change. The initial
amounts of all the species are shown in Table 1. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.508,t=0.373,r=0.911,b=0.641), with ID 04ae03f5-2ff1-4d94-a670-c510841afbaa -->

reflect experimental measurements. For example, the
parameters for protein synthesis and misfolding can be
calculated from knowledge of the protein half-life and the
steady state levels of misfolded protein. Other parameter
values such as those for the ubiquitin pathway are cur-
rently unknown but experimental work in the lab of DG
is being carried out to quantify some of the reactions rates.
Before this data becomes available, we try to find a set of
parameters that will give output corresponding to the
expected steady state of an unstressed cell e.g. no accumu-
lation of misfolded protein and only small fluctuations in
levels of native protein, ATP, ADP and ROS. To do this we
initially estimate the unknown parameters and then run a
simulation and check the model output. The parameters
shown in Tables 2 and 3 corresponded to a steady state as
shown in Figure 2b. We then investigated which parame-
ters affected the half-life of the protein substrate by setting
the rate of protein synthesis to zero and altering each of
the other parameters in turn. We also examined the effects
of inhibiting the proteasome by setting the parameter for
degradation to zero and the effects of shutting down E1
activity. For example, with our original choice of parame-
ters our model predicted that if E1 activity is shut down,
then there is an almost immediate conversion of ubiqui-
tin conjugates to monomeric ubiquitin. However, experi-
mental data shows that this conversion takes about two
hours (Fig 5a). Therefore, we adjusted the parameters to
reduce the rates of the reactions involved in ubiquitina-
tion, de-ubiquitination and degradation until the model
output fitted the experimental data. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.082,t=0.105,r=0.491,b=0.554), with ID 7dfe96bd-7f04-4e72-94c5-2ba5d0bcf7a2 -->

We now describe each of the parameters in turn and give
an interpretation of their values in terms of reaction kinet-
ics. The parameters $k_1$, $k_2$ and $k_3$ were set so that the half-
life of the pool of protein equals about 10 hours, and
under normal conditions, there is only a very low propor-
tion of misfolded protein [45]. The parameter $k_{61}$ for E3/
MisP binding is set so that the average time for one E3 to
bind to MisP is about 10 minutes. The parameter $k_{61r}$ is set
so that the reverse reaction (dissociation of E3 from MisP)
happens once every 100 minutes. So the forward reaction
is 10 times stronger than the reverse reaction. The param-
eter $k_{62}$ for E1/Ub binding is set so that about 40 ubiquitin
molecules are activated every minute and the parameter
$k_{63}$ for E2/Ub binding is set to give about 6 reactions per
minute. The parameter $k_{64}$ for monoubiquitination is set
so that once MisP is bound by E3 it takes about 10 sec-
onds to receive the first Ub molecule. The parameter $k_{65}$ <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.566,r=0.489,b=0.821), with ID 1768bfb1-c657-4d33-b002-2179d0f7c5a3 -->

for polyubiquitination is set so that it took about one sec-
ond for each additional Ub molecule to be added to the
chain. So each polyubiquitination step is about 10 times
faster than the first ubiquitiantion reaction. The parame-
ter $k_{66}$ for the de-ubiquitination reactions is set so that it
takes about 8 minutes for each reaction. It is necessary that
this reaction is very slow compared to the ubiquitination
reactions so that the model output fits the experimental
data when E1 activity is shut down (see section 4.4). The
parameter $k_{67}$ for the binding of ubiquitinated proteins
(with chains of 4 or more ubiquitin molecules) to the pro-
teasome is set so that under normal conditions when
there are about 200 ubiquitin conjugates present in the
cell, on average about 5 reactions per second are occur-
ring. The parameter $k_{68}$ for the de-ubiquitination of pro-
teasome-bound ubiquitinated proteins is set to be equal
to $k_{66}$. We assume that this reaction is slow so that pro-
teins with long chains are highly likely to reside long
enough at the proteasome for degradation to take place,
whereas proteins with short chains may be shortened to
below the required threshold and would then dissociate
from the proteasome. The parameter $k_{69}$ for proteasome
activity is set so that it takes about 15 seconds to degrade
each proteasome-bound ubiquitinated protein. We ini-
tially set $k_{71}$ and $k_{72}$ to be equal to $10^{-7}$ as in the model of
Proctor et al. [30]. However, with these values, aggregates
sometimes formed even under normal conditions (data
not shown). Therefore we lowered the values until we
obtained results in which the appearance of aggregates
was very unlikely under normal conditions. This was sat-
isfied with $k_{71}$ and $k_{72}$ set equal to $10^{-8}$. The parameter $k_{73}$
for sequestering aggregates is set so that if there is a low
level of aggregates in the cell (1–10), then on average
there are 0.05 reactions per second, so each reaction
takes about 3 minutes for each reaction. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.506,t=0.105,r=0.913,b=0.627), with ID 1bf3c212-5d87-4638-bf3a-9d05e4a8611b -->

The parameter $k_{74}$ is set so that there is an equal probability of an aggregated protein being sequestered or binding to the proteasome when all the proteasomes are available for binding. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.507,t=0.639,r=0.912,b=0.701), with ID d9bf6812-71ff-41b2-8992-474a177592d2 -->

By setting the parameter for protein synthesis, *k*₁, to zero we can use our model to check the half-life of the protein pool.

*Shutting down E1 activity*  
It is very straight forward to mimic this experiment with our *in silico* model by adding an event to the SBML code so that at a certain time-point the parameter for the E1/Ub binding reaction is set to zero. This event is equivalent to putting the cells at the non-permissive temperature in the wet lab experiment. We chose 30 minutes as the time-point at which this event occurred to allow time for ubiquitin conjugates to form. The details of the event are given in Table 4. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.084,t=0.224,r=0.489,b=0.375), with ID cdb25ed8-360e-4808-96b0-6224ee09f452 -->
