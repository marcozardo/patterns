A simple model of circadian rhythms based on transcriptional activation of a clock gene and translation of a clock protein, with feedback regulation.
This model is based on the paper:
Leloup JC, Goldbeter A. A model for circadian rhythms in Drosophila incorporating the formation of a complex between the PER and TIM proteins. J Biol Rhythms. 1998 Feb;13(1):70-87. doi: 10.1177/074873049801300108. PMID: 9481747.
