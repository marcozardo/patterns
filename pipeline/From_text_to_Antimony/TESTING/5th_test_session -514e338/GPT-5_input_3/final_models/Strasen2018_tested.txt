/* Unmapped or approximated elements from the source:
- Exact kinetic parameters, volumes, and initial conditions were not provided in the excerpt; placeholder values were chosen to ensure an executable model.
- The model topology follows Fig. 4B: ligand?receptor binding/internalization/degradation, SMAD2 phosphorylation, SMAD4 complex formation, nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, and transcriptional negative feedback acting at receptor level (e.g., SMAD7). PPM1A-mediated dephosphorylation is represented as cytosolic S2p -> S2; nuclear dephosphorylation/export was simplified.
- Restimulation protocols (adding ligand at defined times) and pharmacological inhibition (e.g., SB431542, DRB) are not encoded as Events due to missing exact timing/doses in the excerpt.
- Heterogeneity and signaling class decomposition were captured in the original study by varying total protein levels across subpopulations; this Antimony model provides the deterministic core module without stochastic/ensemble sampling.
