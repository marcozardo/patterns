/*
Unmapped or simplified elements due to missing explicit equations/parameters in the provided text:
- Explicit ODEs/parameters from Figure S6 (supplement) not available; normalized placeholders used.
- MEN detailed components (Tem1, Cdc15, Mob1/Dbf2) and Polo/Bfa1/Bub2 are lumped into the single variable MEN, inhibited by high Cdk and activated by Cdc14; Bfa1 phosphorylation and Polo regulation are not explicitly modeled as separate species.
- Sic1 (Cdk inhibitor) and APC^Cdh1-dependent Polo degradation are not explicitly represented; Cdh1 activation is modeled phenomenologically by Cdc14 vs Cdk balance.
- Securin as a free species is not modeled; securin?separase complex (SepCplx) stands for the inhibited separase pool undergoing APC^Cdc20-dependent activation.
- Quantitative magnitudes (e.g., ?PP2A^Cdc55 activity decreases to less than half at anaphase onset?) are captured qualitatively via PP2A assignment rule; exact time courses from Figure 5 are not parameter-fitted here.
- The model omits cell-cycle entry regulators and upstream checkpoints; it focuses on the metaphase-to-G1 mitotic exit module described in Figure 7A.
