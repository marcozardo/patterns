Looking at the error report, the issue is that `FB_protein` is being governed by both a rate rule and a reaction (`Feedback_inhibition`). According to SBML rules, a species cannot be determined simultaneously by both reactions and rules.

In the current model:
- `FB_protein` has a rate rule that defines its dynamics
- `FB_protein` also appears in the `Feedback_inhibition` reaction as a catalyst

The solution is to make `FB_protein` a boundary species since it's being controlled by a rate rule and should not be affected by reaction stoichiometry.

Here's the corrected Antimony model:

```

The key change is in the "Compartment and Species" section where `FB_protein` is now declared as a boundary species using the `$` symbol: `$FB_protein in cytoplasm`. This ensures that its dynamics are controlled solely by the rate rule, while still allowing it to participate in the `Feedback_inhibition` reaction as a catalyst.
