  /*
  Model based on the "Full Model" from:
  Schmierer et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:139
  "Hypoxia-dependent sequestration of an oxygen sensor by a widespread structural motif
  can shape the hypoxic response - a predictive kinetic model"
  
  The model is dimensionless as described in the paper.
