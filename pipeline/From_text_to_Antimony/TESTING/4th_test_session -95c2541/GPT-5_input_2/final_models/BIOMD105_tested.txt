/* Unmapped or ambiguous data and modeling notes:
- Several entries in Table 2/3 of the source were OCR-degraded (shown as '?'). Parameter values used here were consolidated from legible values in the tables and the Methods text:
  k1=0.01; k2=2e-6; k3=4e-6; k61=1.7e-5; k61r=2e-4; k62=2e-4; k63=1e-3; k64=1e-3; k65=1e-2; k66=1e-5; k67=1e-5; k68=1e-5; k69=1e-3; k71=1e-8; k72=1e-8; k73=1e-3; k74=1e-5.
- ATP/ADP/AMP/ROS are modeled as boundary species (constant pools), as stated in the paper. They appear in reactions but are not updated by them.
- The dissociation step for MisP_Ub4_Proteasome (requiring DUB) uses parameter 'kdss', set equal to k68 due to lack of a distinct reported value.
- Deubiquitination of free and proteasome-bound substrates releases one Ub per step, consistent with Table 2 and Methods descriptions.
- Aggregation reactions included are those explicitly shown in Table 3 excerpts; many other pairings alluded to by "?" are omitted due to incomplete listing.
- An event that shuts down E1 activity at 0.5 h (time >= 1800 s) is included (setting k62=0) to reproduce ts20 experiments; remove or modify this event to simulate other conditions (e.g., normal or proteasome inhibition by setting k69=0).
