The corrected Antimony model is as follows:

```antimony
model *Kimmel2021_StemCellDifferentiation()

  // Compartments and Species:
  compartment compartment_;
  species S in compartment_, D in compartment_, A in compartment_;

  // Assignment Rules:
  alpha := alpha0 * (1 + alpha1 * A);
  beta := beta0 * (1 + beta1 * A);
  gamma := gamma0 * (1 + gamma1 * A);

  // Reactions:
  SelfRenewal: S => 2 S; compartment_ * alpha * S;
  Differentiation: S => D; compartment_ * beta * S;
  Apoptosis: S => ; compartment_ * gamma * S;
  AProduction: S => A; compartment_ * delta * S;
  ADecay: A => ; compartment_ * epsilon * A;

  // Species initializations:
  S = 1000;
  D = 0;
  A = 0;

  // Compartment initializations:
  compartment_ = 1;

  // Variable initializations:
  alpha0 = 0.01;
  alpha1 = 0.005;
  beta0 = 0.005;
  beta1 = 0.002;
  gamma0 = 0.001;
  gamma1 = 0.001;
  delta = 0.0001;
  epsilon = 0.01;

  // Other declarations:
  var alpha, beta, gamma;
  const compartment_, alpha0, alpha1, beta0, beta1, gamma0, gamma1, delta, epsilon;
