  // Compartments and Species:
  compartment cytoplasm;
  species S in cytoplasm, P in cytoplasm, W in cytoplasm, E in cytoplasm, F in cytoplasm;

  // Assignment Rules:
  // No explicit assignment rules were provided in the input text.

  // Reactions:
  R1: S -> P; (Vmax1 * S) / (Km1 + S) - (Vmax2 * P) / (Km2 + P);
  R2: P => W; k_cat_F * F * P;

  // Other declarations:

  // Unit definitions:
  unit concentration = 1e-3 mole / litre; // Corresponds to mM
  unit time = second;
