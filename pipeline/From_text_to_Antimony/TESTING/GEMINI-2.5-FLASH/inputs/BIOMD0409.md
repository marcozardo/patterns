SUMMARY

After anaphase, the high mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity is downregulated to promote exit from mitosis. To this end, in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae, the Cdk counter-acting phosphatase Cdc14 is activated. In metaphase, Cdc14 is kept inactive in the nucleolus by its inhibitor Net1. During anaphase, Cdk- and Polo-dependent phosphorylation of Net1 is thought to release active Cdc14. How Net1 is phosphorylated specifically in anaphase, when mitotic kinase activity starts to decline, has remained unexplained. Here, we show that PP2A^Cdc55 phosphatase keeps Net1 under-phosphorylated in metaphase. The sister chromatid-separating protease separase, activated at anaphase onset, interacts with and downregulates PP2A^Cdc55, thereby facilitating Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation. PP2A^Cdc55 downregulation also promotes phosphorylation of Bfa1, contributing to activation of the “mitotic exit network” that sustains Cdc14 as Cdk activity declines. These findings allow us to present a new quantitative model for mitotic exit in budding yeast. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.114,t=0.361,r=0.496,b=0.761), with ID be205fba-ce80-4bc4-9b40-88f38803d68a -->

**INTRODUCTION**

Entry into mitosis in the eukaryotic cell cycle is promoted by the increasing activity of mitotic kinases, including Cdk and Polo. Cells in metaphase reach a peak in kinase activity. Provided that all chromosomes are correctly aligned on the mitotic spindle, this will lead to activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), a multisubunit ubiquitin ligase. The APC ubiquitylates securin, an inhibitor of the protease separase, thereby targeting securin for destruction by the proteasome. Free separase in turn <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.114,t=0.781,r=0.497,b=0.943), with ID bec2a73c-c6e8-4941-9664-11fed049fae3 -->

cleaves the cohesive link between sister chromatids to
trigger anaphase. At the same time, the APC starts to ubiq-
uitylate cyclins and later also Polo to downregulate mitotic
kinases (Morgan, 1999; Zachariae and Nasmyth, 1999). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.523,t=0.364,r=0.904,b=0.421), with ID b1a9faec-0a6b-494b-b025-ff8ff2230497 -->

Activation of the APC at anaphase onset occurs through an activatory subunit, called Cdc20. In budding yeast, this form of the APC (APC^Cdc20) initiates cyclin destruction but is not by itself sufficient to complete mitotic exit. A second essential step during mitotic exit is activation of the Cdk counteracting phosphatase Cdc14. Cdc14 contributes to Cdk downregulation by dephosphorylating both a second APC activatory subunit, Cdh1, that sustains APC activity at low Cdk levels, as well as the Cdk inhibitor Sic1 (Visintin et al., 1998). Cdc14 also directly counteracts Cdk activity by reversing phosphorylation of Cdk substrates. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.523,t=0.422,r=0.904,b=0.575), with ID 53f32a5f-ca36-42fa-9e2d-32631722b5df -->

Cdc14 phosphatase is sequestered and kept inactive
in the nucleolus for most of the cell cycle by binding to
the nucleolar protein Net1 (also called Cfi1) (Shou et al.,
1999; Visintin et al., 1999). Release from the nucleolus
and activation of Cdc14 in anaphase occurs after phos-
phorylation of Net1, depending on both Cdk and Polo.
Phosphorylated Net1 shows reduced affinity for and
in vitro no longer inhibits Cdc14 (Azzam et al., 2004; Shou
et al., 2002; Yoshida and Toh-e, 2002). A G protein signal-
ing cascade that involves Polo, the mitotic exit network
(MEN), is essential in budding yeast for Cdc14 activation
(Jaspersen et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2001; Stegmeier and
Amon, 2004). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.524,t=0.575,r=0.905,b=0.757), with ID 6171e3d7-f600-46cc-8144-959f09f05d6a -->

At anaphase onset Cdc14 is initially activated independently of MEN, in a reaction that has been called Cdc14 early anaphase release (FEAR; Stegmeier et al., 2002). A number of proteins, including Cdk, Polo, Slk19, Spo12, and separase have been implicated in this early release, and it requires Net1 phosphorylation at Cdk consensus sites (Azzam et al., 2004). It is not known how and which of these FEAR components conveys an anaphase-specific Cdc14 release signal. A good candidate is separase, which is released from its inhibitor securin at this time. Ectopic expression of separase in metaphase is indeed sufficient to trigger Cdc14 activation, in a reaction independent of its proteolytic activity (Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003).

Type 2A phosphatases (PP2A) are a group of abundant
protein phosphatases involved in several essential aspects
of cell growth and proliferation (Stark, 1996). These phos-
phatases consist of a scaffold protein (Tpd3 in budding
yeast) that associates with a catalytic subunit (one of the
closely related Pph21 or Pph22) and one of three regulatory
subunits (Rts1, Rts3, or Cdc55). The latter is thought to
provide substrate specificity. We refer to PP2A^Cdc55^ as
a complex consisting of Tpd3, either Pph21 or Pph22,
and Cdc55. Previous studies have shown that Cdc55
regulates inhibitory Cdk tyrosine phosphorylation and is
required for stable mitotic arrest in response to spindle
damage. Recently, a role of Cdc55 in mitotic exit has been
described (Minshull et al., 1996; Wang and Ng, 2006; Yell-
man and Burke, 2006). <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.096,t=0.183,r=0.477,b=0.393), with ID 59fbb647-2c53-477c-8491-c0c63a82d351 -->

Here we show that in metaphase, PP2A^Cdc55^ prevents premature Net1 phosphorylation and Cdc14 activation. At anaphase onset, PP2A^Cdc55^ activity is downregulated in a separase-dependent manner, triggering a first wave of Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation and Cdc14 release. Utilizing a new conditional allele of separase we show that separase is the essential trigger for Cdc14 activation in anaphase. We present a quantitative model of how PP2A^Cdc55^ downregulation, together with Cdc14 activation and cyclin proteolysis, promotes mitotic exit. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.096,t=0.393,r=0.477,b=0.536), with ID ae366796-5431-4a44-a339-fcf38134f660 -->

RESULTS

Separase Activation Is Essential for Mitotic Exit
Conditional mutants in budding yeast separase have been described that block chromosome segregation by largely reducing, but not eliminating, cohesin cleavage. Such mutants introduce a delay to the nucleolar release of Cdc14 (McGrew et al., 1992; Stegmeier et al., 2002; Uhlmann et al., 1999). This suggested that separase contributes to but is not essential for mitotic exit. We were prompted to revisit the possibility that separase plays a more decisive role in mitotic exit by three considerations: (1) The separase alleles so far studied likely present a hypomorphic and not the true null phenotype. (2) An undegradable version of the separase inhibitor securin, carrying a mutated destruction box motif (securin^mdb), not only prevents chromosome segregation but also blocks mitotic exit (Cohen-Fix and Koshland, 1999). (3) Ectopic separase expression in metaphase is sufficient for Cdc14 activation and triggers mitotic exit if cyclin levels are reduced (Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003). <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.095,t=0.545,r=0.476,b=0.841), with ID cb85287b-1009-4b0d-8338-155b70338c49 -->

We first asked by which mechanism securin^mdb^ blocks mitotic exit. Securin could inhibit Cdc14 activation or prevent mitotic exit in a different way. Cells were arrested in metaphase by depletion of the APC activator Cdc20 under control of the methionine-repressible MET3 promoter, and securin^mdb^ was induced from the galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter. Then cells were released into synchronous <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.096,t=0.841,r=0.477,b=0.942), with ID 3a23d7e0-9f25-45af-9e39-a929b1f69528 -->

anaphase by reinduction of Cdc20. Endogenous securin
was rapidly degraded, and in control cells without secur-
in^mdb^ Cdc14 was released from the nucleolus at the same
time (Figure 1A). The presence of securin^mdb^ prevented
both Cdc14 release and mitotic exit, suggesting that
securin blocks mitotic progression by inhibiting Cdc14
activation. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.506,t=0.126,r=0.884,b=0.225), with ID c5a978fc-334f-44d4-9083-b3c12e071063 -->

We next wanted to know whether securin blocks Cdc14
release through inhibiting separase. If this was the case,
inactivation of separase should also lead to a mitotic
block. We generated a new conditional allele of separase
(esp1-2td) by fusing a degron cassette to the thermosensi-
tive esp1-2 allele, expressed from the native ESP1 pro-
moter. Then we compared cell-cycle progression in an
allelic series of wild-type, esp1-1, esp1-2, and esp1-2td
cells, released from an α factor block in G1 (Figure 1B).
As reported, Cdc14 nucleolar release and mitotic exit
are delayed in esp1-1 mutant cells, when compared to
wild-type (Stegmeier et al., 2002). Cdc14 release was fur-
ther reduced and delayed in the esp1-2 mutant and almost
entirely blocked in the esp1-2td strain. After defective ana-
phase, esp1-1 mutant cells undergo delayed cytokinesis
to produce aneuploid daughter cells. Cytokinesis was fur-
ther delayed by the esp1-2 mutation, and esp1-2td cells
failed to undergo cytokinesis and remained arrested in
mitosis. As a control that the arrest was not due to a failure
of APCCdc20 activation, we analyzed securin that was
degraded in all strains with similar timing (Figure 1B).
The mitotic arrest after securinmdb expression or separase
inactivation could be overcome by ectopic Cdc14 activa-
tion using net1-1 or the dominant-active Cdc14 allele
CDC14-TAB6 (Figure S1; Shou and Deshaies, 2002).
This suggests that separase inactivation in budding yeast
leads to a Cdc14-block in mitosis, caused by the failure
to activate Cdc14. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.505,t=0.225,r=0.887,b=0.619), with ID 074d46b1-f20d-4d36-8fcc-d5284196c1d2 -->

Separase Promotes Net1 Phosphorylation  
Cdc14 activation in early anaphase depends on Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation (Azzam et al., 2004). We tested whether this phosphorylation is controlled by separase, using an antibody that recognizes a Cdk-dependent, anaphase-specific Net1 phospho-epitope. Cells were arrested in metaphase by depletion of Cdc20, and separase expression was induced from the GAL1 promoter (Figure 2A). The Net1 phospho-epitope became detectable coincidentally with Cdc14 release. To analyze whether Net1 phosphorylation was responsible for separase-induced Cdc14 release, we repeated the experiment using the net1-6Cdk mutant that lacks six Cdk phosphorylation sites required for early Cdc14 release (Azzam et al., 2004). After separase induction, Cdc14 nucleolar release was strongly reduced by the net1-6Cdk mutation (Figure 2B). This suggests that separase induces Cdc14 activation by promoting Net1 phosphorylation. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.505,t=0.629,r=0.887,b=0.883), with ID f9cd345a-62d9-4cd0-a268-dc0b8d361970 -->

It was important to know whether Net1 phosphorylation
during normal anaphase also depends on separase. There-
fore, wild-type and esp1-2 mutant cells were synchronized
in metaphase by Cdc20 depletion and released into <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.505,t=0.883,r=0.887,b=0.942), with ID 29e2b25a-d423-468c-87d0-68a6ebf8c69f -->

(A) Securin blocks Cdc14 release. Strain Y1851 (MATa MET-CDC20 CDC14-HA6 PDS1-myc18), with or without GAL-PDS1mdb (encoding securinmdb), was arrested in metaphase (meta) by Cdc20 depletion, and securinmdb expression was induced. Cells were released into synchronous anaphase by Cdc20 readdition. Cdc14 nucleolar release and the presence of endogenous securin were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence. Clb2 levels were analyzed by Western blotting, using Cdc28 as loading control.  
(B) The separase allele esp1-2td blocks mitotic exit. Strains Y1504 (MATa CDC14-HA6 PDS1-Pk3 GAL-UBR1), Y1825 (as Y1504, but esp1-1), Y1505 (as Y1504, but esp1-2), and Y1507 (as Y1504, but esp1-2td) were arrested in G1 with α factor. Ubr1 was induced by galactose addition and cultures shifted to 37°C for 2 hr before release into a synchronous cell cycle. Swi6 served as a loading control for Clb2 and securin. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.113,t=0.783,r=0.907,b=0.887), with ID 273d8b14-47fd-4377-a45b-d88715d09382 -->

synchronous anaphase by Cdc20 readdition (Figure 2C). In
wild-type cells, phospho-Net1 appeared concomitant with

Figure 2.  Separase Promotes Net1 Phosphorylation
(A) Ectopic separase induces a Cdk-dependent Net1 phospho-epitope. Strain Y2170 (MATa MET-CDC20 GAL-Flag-ESP1 CDC14-HA6 NET1-Pk3) was arrested in metaphase (meta) and separase expression induced. Cdc14 nuclear release and spindle elongation were monitored by immunofluorescence. Net1 phosphorylation was detected using the phospho-Net1-specific antibody PP-B (Azzam et al., 2004). Total Net1 was detected by the Pk epitope tag.
(B) Cdk phosphorylation sites are required for separase-induced Cdc14 release. Strains Y2807 (MATa GAL-Flag-ESP1 CDC14-Pk9) and Y2808 (as Y2807, but net1-6Cdk) were arrested in metaphase by nocodazole treatment and separase expression induced. The rate of spindle elongation was similar in both strains (not shown). <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.625,t=0.124,r=0.889,b=0.382), with ID 258b35df-097c-4e7c-a60d-9d08088116df -->

(C) Separase-dependent Net1 phosphorylation
in anaphase. Strains Y2639 (MATa MET-CDC20
CDC14-HA6  PDS1-myc18  NET1-Pk3) and
Y2640 (as Y2639, but esp1-2) were arrested in
metaphase by Cdc20 depletion and shifted
to the restrictive temperature (37°C) 3 hr before
release into anaphase. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.624,t=0.382,r=0.890,b=0.468), with ID e6d38edd-c038-4ff5-8655-aedf6534c96d -->

Cdk Is Responsible for Separase-Induced
Cdc14 Activation
We next confirmed that Cdk itself, and not another kinase
that might recognize the Cdk consensus sites on Net1,
was responsible for separase-induced Cdc14 activation.
Cells carrying the ATP analog (1NM-PP1)-sensitive Cdk
allele cdc28-as1 (Bishop et al., 2000) were arrested in
metaphase by nocodazole treatment, then 1NM-PP1
was added and separase expression induced (Figure 3A).
Cells containing wild-type Cdc28 released Cdc14 from the
nucleolus as expected, but inhibition of Cdc28-as1 by
1NM-PP1 efficiently blocked Cdc14 release. This demon- <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.095,t=0.767,r=0.481,b=0.942), with ID 4c1270d9-64fa-408f-9d6c-c328740eeefb -->

Cdk activity. <!-- text, from page 3 (l=0.504,t=0.770,r=0.887,b=0.799), with ID ea7d9c6c-358c-492c-82bd-34bc381eb5da -->

Polo has also been implicated in Cdc14 activation at anaphase onset. We therefore repeated the experiment but inactivated Polo using the tight temperature-sensitive cdc5-4 allele (Park et al., 2003; Figure 3B). Cdc14 release occurred with the same kinetics in cdc5-4 and wild-type cells. This suggests that mainly Cdk, but not Polo, is responsible for separase-induced Net1 phosphorylation. These results are consistent with an essential role for Polo later in mitotic exit as part of MEN.

• Wild-type cells show coordinated Cdc14 release, separase activation, Clb2 degradation, and progression through mitotic exit (binucleation, DNA segregation, spindle elongation).
• Mutant strains (cdc28-as1, cdc5-4) fail to release Cdc14, do not degrade Clb2, and do not progress through mitotic exit, as confirmed by FACS, microscopy, and protein analysis.
• The data support a requirement for Cdc28 and Cdc5 activity in Cdc14 release and mitotic exit in yeast. <!-- figure, from page 4 (l=0.104,t=0.122,r=0.624,b=0.726), with ID 072bb49e-382d-4d03-b86e-aed97031e752 -->

Figure 3. Cdk Confers Separase-In-
duced Net1 Phosphorylation
(A) Cdk activity is required for separase-induced
Cdc14 release. Strains Y828 (MATa GAL-Flag-
ESP1 CDC14-HA6) and Y2178 (as Y828, but
cdc28-as1) were arrested in metaphase by no-
codozale treatment. One micromolar 1NM-PP1
was added to inhibit Cdc28-as1 and separase
was induced 15 min later.
(B) Polo is not required for separase-induced
Cdc14 release. Strains Y2286 (MATa GAL-
Flag-ESP1 CDC14-myc18) and Y2288 (as
Y2286, but cdc5-4) were arrested in metaphase
with nocodazole and shifted to 37°C for 60 min
before separase induction.
(C) Cdk is required for Cdc14 activation at ana-
phase onset. Strains Y2298 (MATa GAL-
CDC20 CDC14-HA6) and Y2428 (as Y2298,
but cdc28-as1 CDC5-Pk3) were arrested in
metaphase by depletion of Cdc20; 1 μM 1NM-
PP1 was added 15 min before Cdc20 readdi-
tion. Photographs are shown of cells 20 min af-

Cdk Activity against Net1 Is Downregulated
at the Time of Cdc14 Release
The above results suggest that separase induces Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation in anaphase. This presents a paradox, as at this time overall Cdk activity starts to decline. One possible explanation could be a separase-dependent specificity change of Cdk. Cyclin Clb2-associated Cdk activity promotes Net1 phosphorylation during <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.518,t=0.821,r=0.909,b=0.948), with ID 0ba95000-caa2-44e5-91d4-d4195d566c29 -->

unable to complete mitotic exit (Figure S2). <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.115,t=0.739,r=0.494,b=0.767), with ID b9094d55-881a-4ffe-b3f8-4a0048bc70a4 -->

To explicitly test the role of Cdk-mediated Net1 phosphorylation during mitotic exit, we analyzed whether cells can exit from mitosis without Cdk activity. Cells were synchronized in metaphase by Cdc20 depletion, then Cdc28-as1 was inhibited with 1NM-PP1, and Cdc20 reinduced (Figure 3C). Control cells containing wild-type Cdc28 underwent anaphase, activated Cdc14, and completed mitotic exit. In contrast, cdc28-as1 cells kept Cdc14 sequestered in the nucleolus and did not exit. This was in spite of the fact that Clb2 was degraded and chromosome segregation occurred in both cultures, indicating that APC^Cdc20 was active. Binucleate formation was less efficien <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.114,t=0.771,r=0.498,b=0.942), with ID 2c3bd09b-123a-4129-ac18-482457c62400 -->

anaphase (Azzam et al., 2004), therefore we measured its
in vitro activity against Net1 after purification from syn-
chronous cells. The substrate was a recombinant frag-
ment of Net1, spanning amino acids 1–600, that in vivo
is sufficient for cell cycle-regulated Cdc14 inhibition (Az-
zam et al., 2004; Traverso et al., 2001). As control sub-
strate we used histone H1, against which Cdk activity is
expected to decline during anaphase. Clb2-associated
Cdk activity against both Net1 (1–600) and H1 started to
decline as soon as cells entered anaphase and Cdc14
was released (Figure S3). While this in vitro assay may
not fully recapitulate possible regulation of Cdk specificity
in vivo, it did not reveal evidence for increased Net1 phos-
phorylation in anaphase. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.095,t=0.124,r=0.478,b=0.326), with ID 05c38740-200c-4bad-ba21-c5459c0ced56 -->

PP2ACdc55 Prevents Cdc14 Release in Metaphase
Instead, we considered whether a phosphatase might limit
Net1 phosphorylation in metaphase, as has been sug-
gested based on theoretical considerations (Chen et al.,
2004). Defects in mitotic progression have been reported
due to mutations in the budding yeast type 2A phospha-
tase (Evans and Stark, 1997; Minshull et al., 1996), there-
fore we analyzed its possible influence on Net1 phosphor-
ylation. We individually deleted each of the three PP2A
regulatory subunits, Rts1, Rts3, and Cdc55, and analyzed
cell-cycle progression after synchronous release from
G1 (Figure S4). rts34 cells behaved identical to the
wild-type control, while both rts1Δ and cdc554 cells
showed a noticeable delay in progression through mitosis.
Release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus coincided with
anaphase in rts1Δ cells but was delayed by 10 min in
cdc554 cells. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.095,t=0.334,r=0.478,b=0.575), with ID e5a0d66d-ac65-4940-864b-f8fcc322c0d1 -->

To further analyze the roles of Rts1 and Cdc55, we synchronized cells at the metaphase to anaphase transition. cdc55Δ cells cannot be stably arrested in metaphase by nocodazole treatment (Minshull et al., 1996), but Cdc20 depletion allowed a robust block. After release into anaphase by Cdc20 readdition, the kinetics of Cdc14 nucleolar release was indistinguishable between rts1Δ and wild-type cells (Figure S4). In contrast, Cdc14 was prematurely released from the nucleolus of cdc55Δ cells arrested in metaphase (Figure 4A). Furthermore, resequestration of Cdc14 after release into anaphase occurred with a delay of at least 20 min. Premature Cdc14 release in cdc55Δ cells was accompanied by the appearance of the Cdk-specific Net1 phospho-epitope. As a consequence of hyperphosphorylation, the interaction between Net1 and Cdc14 was weakened, and less Cdc14 coprecipitated with Net1 from cdc55Δ metaphase cells compared to wild-type (Figure 4B). These findings suggest that PP2ACdc55 prevents Cdc14 release in metaphase by counteracting Net1 phosphorylation. These results are consistent with premature nucleolar release of Cdc14 in nocodazole-treated cdc55Δ cells, as recently described (Wang and Ng, 2006; Yellman and Burke, 2006). <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.095,t=0.575,r=0.477,b=0.897), with ID bb132999-3b88-45a4-a514-810219b533d5 -->

tosis with compromised Cdk activity because of inhibitory Cdc28-Y19 phosphorylation (Minshull et al., 1996). To correct for this difference we introduced the CDC28Y19F allele that is refractory to inhibition. Compared to both cdc55Δ and CDC28Y19F single mutants, the cdc55Δ CDC28Y19F strain showed significantly advanced Cdc14 release from the nucleolus. Cdc14 was released in many cells that judged by their short mitotic spindle were still in metaphase (Figure 4C), confirming that Cdc55 counteracts Cdc14 release. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.504,t=0.125,r=0.886,b=0.267), with ID d82293d1-6bf3-4532-9487-be888bf2b120 -->

PP2A regulatory subunits are not always acting as sub-
strate-specific activators. To analyze whether indeed
PP2A phosphatase activity opposes Net1 phosphoryla-
tion, we used a strain carrying a deletion of PPH21 and
a temperature-sensitive pph22-172 allele to inactivate
the two PP2A catalytic subunits. Pph3 phosphatase can
partly compensate for PP2A function in budding yeast
and was therefore also deleted from this strain (Evans
and Stark, 1997) (Figure 4D). Net1 phosphorylation was
detectable in pph3Δpph21Δpph22-172 cells, arrested in
metaphase by nocodazole treatment, already at permis-
sive conditions. Phosphorylation increased after shift to
the restrictive temperature, and Cdc14 was released
from the nucleolus. Sic1 started to accumulate, confirm-
ing that Cdc14 was activated. This suggests that PP2A
phosphatase activity is required to keep Net1 underphos-
phorylated in metaphase. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.505,t=0.267,r=0.887,b=0.508), with ID f56b2e3e-5473-47e9-92cb-4ae7f8315357 -->

**Separase-Dependent Downregulation  
of PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> at Anaphase Onset**  
If PP2A<sup>Cdc55</sup> counteracts Net1 phosphorylation in metaphase, does its activity change during anaphase to allow Net1 phosphorylation? We first visualized Cdc55 localization at the metaphase to anaphase transition. Cdc55 shows abundant nuclear localization throughout the cell cycle (Gentry and Hallberg, 2002 and data not shown). To detect nucleolar localization, we immunostained spread chromosomes from which nucleoplasmic protein has been washed away (Figure 5A). Colocalization with Net1 revealed nucleolar enrichment of Cdc55 in metaphase. Cdc55 was still enriched in the nucleolus in cells released into synchronous anaphase. Thus, while Cdc55 is at the right place to keep Net1 underphosphorylated in metaphase, no localization change is obvious during anaphase. <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.504,t=0.517,r=0.887,b=0.757), with ID ee18a686-0972-424d-bed0-9556cd7abb9d -->

We then measured the in vitro phosphatase activity of
PP2A^Cdc55^ after immunopurification from synchronous cul-
tures. As substrates, we prepared in vitro ^32^P-phosphory-
lated histone H1 and Net1 (1–600). Cdc55 immunoprecip-
itates from cultures undergoing synchronous metaphase
to anaphase transition were incubated with these sub-
strates, and release of acid soluble ^32^P-phosphate was
quantified by scintillation counting (Figure 5B). After the re-
action, the yield of Cdc55 in the immunoprecipitates was
quantified by Western blotting. In metaphase, significant

sured using both substrates. During anaphase, protein

multi-panel data figure:
# Panel A: Cell Cycle Progression and Cdc14 Release

## Flow Cytometry Profiles :
  • Two 3D line plots show DNA content (1c, 2c) over time (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 min, meta) for wt (left) and cdc55Δ (right).
  • Both strains start at 1c, progress to 2c, and return to 1c, but cdc55Δ shows altered timing.

## Quantification of Cdc14 Release and Anaphase Spindles :
  • Two line graphs (wt left, cdc55Δ right) plot % of cells (y-axis) vs. time (x-axis, 0–100 min).
  • Open circles: Cdc14 release; filled circles: anaphase spindles.
  • wt: Cdc14 release and anaphase spindles peak at ~40 min, then decline.
  • cdc55Δ: Cdc14 release is earlier and more sustained; anaphase spindles are delayed and reduced.

## Immunofluorescence Images :
  • Representative images for wt and cdc55Δ at peak Cdc14 release.
  • DAPI (blue): DNA; Cdc14 (orange): nucleolar/cytoplasmic localization; tubulin (green): spindle.
  • wt: Cdc14 released from nucleolus, clear anaphase spindle.
  • cdc55Δ: Cdc14 release is more pronounced, spindle morphology altered.

## Western Blot Analysis :
  • Time course (meta, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 min) for wt and cdc55Δ.
  • Blots probed for Θ-Net1 (phosphorylated), Net1-Pk (total), and Clb2.
  • cdc55Δ shows earlier and more persistent Θ-Net1 signal compared to wt.

# Panel B: Co-immunoprecipitation of Net1-Pk and Cdc14

## Input and IP Samples :
  • Input: Net1-Pk detected in both wt and cdc55Δ.
  • α-Pk IP: Immunoprecipitation of Net1-Pk from wt and cdc55Δ.
  • Blots probed for Cdc14 and Net1-Pk.
  • Cdc14 co-precipitates with Net1-Pk in wt, but association is reduced in cdc55Δ.

# Design Encodings :
  • Line plots: open vs. filled circles for different events.
  • Immunofluorescence: blue (DAPI), orange (Cdc14), green (tubulin).
  • Western blots: band intensity and migration for phosphorylation state.
  • Co-IP: presence/absence of bands for protein-protein interaction.

# Analysis :
  • cdc55Δ cells show premature and sustained Cdc14 release, altered spindle dynamics, and persistent Net1 phosphorylation.
  • The association between Net1 and Cdc14 is reduced in cdc55Δ, suggesting Cdc55 is required for Net1 dephosphorylation and stable Net1–Cdc14 interaction.
  • The data support a model where Cdc55 regulates the timing of Cdc14 release and Net1 phosphorylation during mitotic exit. <!-- figure, from page 6 (l=0.108,t=0.119,r=0.483,b=0.550), with ID e61d59b6-93b5-4f0e-a23b-8ec786a2a153 -->

# Cdc14 Release and Cell Cycle Progression in Yeast Mutants

## Title & Axes :
  • No explicit overall title; panel C shows "% of cells" (y-axis) vs. "time (min)" (x-axis) for four genotypes: wt, cdc28Y19F, cdc55Δ, cdc55Δ cdc28Y19F.
  • X-axis: time (min), tick marks at 0, 40, 80, 120.
  • Y-axis: % of cells, tick marks at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100.

## Data Points :
  • For each genotype (wt, cdc28Y19F, cdc55Δ, cdc55Δ cdc28Y19F), three series are plotted:
    – Budding (× markers)
    – Anaphase spindles (△ markers)
    – Cdc14 release (● markers)
  • All series show time-dependent changes, with peaks and declines at different time points.
  • Quantitative values are not explicitly listed, but trends are visible (e.g., Cdc14 release peaks after anaphase spindle formation).

## Design Encodings :
  • Markers: × for budding, △ for anaphase spindles, ● for Cdc14 release.
  • Four separate line plots, one for each genotype.
  • Below plots: representative fluorescence microscopy images for cdc55Δ and cdc55Δ cdc28Y19F, showing DAPI (blue), Cdc14 (orange), and tubulin (green) staining.

## Microscopy Images :
  • Two sets of images, labeled cdc55Δ and cdc55Δ cdc28Y19F.
  • Each set shows three channels: DAPI (nuclear DNA, blue), Cdc14 (orange), tubulin (green).
  • Images illustrate Cdc14 localization and spindle morphology.

## Immunoblot and Quantification (Panel D) :
  • Immunoblots for wt and pph3Δ pph21Δ pph22-172 strains, time points: 0, 40, 80, 120 min.
  • Blots probed for Net1, Net1-Pk, Sic1, Cdc28.
  • Right: line plot of "% Cdc14 release" (y-axis) vs. "min at 37°C" (x-axis), comparing wt (open triangles) and pph3Δ pph21Δ pph22-172 (closed circles).
  • Microscopy images below: DAPI (blue) and Cdc14 (orange) for pph3Δ pph21Δ pph22-172.

## Distribution & Trends :
  • In wt, Cdc14 release peaks after anaphase spindle formation and then declines.
  • cdc28Y19F and cdc55Δ mutants show altered timing and/or extent of Cdc14 release.
  • cdc55Δ cdc28Y19F double mutant shows persistent or aberrant Cdc14 release.
  • In pph3Δ pph21Δ pph22-172, Cdc14 release is sustained or increased compared to wt.
  • Immunoblots show time-dependent changes in Net1, Net1-Pk, Sic1, and Cdc28.

# Analysis :
  • The timing and extent of Cdc14 release are altered in cdc28Y19F, cdc55Δ, and especially in the cdc55Δ cdc28Y19F double mutant, as shown by both quantitative plots and microscopy.
  • The pph3Δ pph21Δ pph22-172 mutant exhibits sustained Cdc14 release, as quantified and visualized.
  • These data suggest that Cdc28, Cdc55, and PP2A phosphatases regulate the dynamics of Cdc14 release during the cell cycle.
  • Microscopy images corroborate the quantitative data, showing differences in Cdc14 localization and spindle morphology between genotypes. <!-- figure, from page 6 (l=0.487,t=0.118,r=0.909,b=0.548), with ID aa0cfb78-6c4f-40e4-b628-0fd760c38ad4 -->

Figure 4.  PP2A^Cdc55 Prevents Net1 Phosphorylation in Metaphase  
(A) Cdc55 deletion causes premature Net1 phosphorylation and Cdc14 nucleolar release in metaphase. Strains Y2118 (MATa MET-CDC20 NET1-Pk3 CDC14-HA6) and Y2389 (as Y2118, but cdc55Δ) were arrested in metaphase and released into synchronous anaphase. Photographs are shown of cells in the metaphase arrest. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.115,t=0.556,r=0.904,b=0.609), with ID b2ab80e7-11ca-4d6b-a1cf-267a640652ed -->

(B) Reduced interaction between Net1 and Cdc14 in the absence of Cdc55. Cell extracts were prepared from strains Y2299 (*MATa MET-CDC20 CDC14-HA6*), Y2118 (as Y2299, but also *NET1-Pk3*), and Y2389 (as 2118, but *cdc55Δ*), and coimmunoprecipitation of Cdc14 with Net1 was analyzed.
(C) Premature Cdc14 nucleolar release in *cdc55Δ CDC28Y19F* cells. Strains Y808 (*MATa CDC14-HA6*), Y2411 (as Y808, but *CDC28Y19F*), Y2426 (as Y808, but *cdc55Δ*), and Y2442 (as Y2426, but *CDC28Y19F*) were arrested with α factor and released into a synchronous cell cycle. Cells shown are from the 80 min time point. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.117,t=0.607,r=0.903,b=0.666), with ID 331f41dc-b665-418e-be41-2f679252f367 -->

(D) Net1 phosphorylation and Cdc14 nucleolar release after inactivation of the PP2A catalytic subunit. Strains Y2498 (MATa NET1-Pk3 CDC14-myc18) and Y2384 (as Y2498, but pph3Δ pph21Δ pph22-172) were arrested in metaphase by nocodazole treatment and shifted to 37°C. The photographs show cells 80 min after the temperature shift. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.116,t=0.667,r=0.903,b=0.705), with ID 0609ce1a-057b-40e9-9af4-9cc8a1f26b46 -->

phosphatase-specific activity decreased to less than half
of the value in metaphase. This suggests that PP2A^Cdc55
activity is downregulated at anaphase onset. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.115,t=0.742,r=0.494,b=0.785), with ID 3bbeb264-6ffe-4430-a7ab-72db424f3c81 -->

To determine whether the decrease of Cdc55-associ-
ated phosphatase activity in anaphase depends on sepa-
rase, we repeated the phosphatase assay using an esp1-2
mutant strain. Cdc55 levels are reduced in esp1 mutant
strains (Figure S5). Phosphatase activity could neverthe-
less be readily measured after Cdc55 immunopurification
from metaphase-arrested cells (Figure 5C). Strikingly, the
phosphatase specific activity remained constant after
release into anaphase. This suggests that separase is
required to downregulate PP2A^Cdc55^ activity at anaphase
onset. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.116,t=0.785,r=0.494,b=0.941), with ID 5241673a-0e28-46c7-bb5c-afebf9e21cdf -->

To address how separase regulates PP2A^Cdc55^, we asked whether separase and Cdc55 physically interact. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that separase forms a complex with Cdc55 (Figure 5D). An interaction could be detected in metaphase cells that became stronger during anaphase when securin was degraded and Cdc14 released. Interaction studies using overexpressed separase and securin confirmed that separase interacts with Cdc55 both in the presence and absence of securin (data not shown). This opens the possibility that direct association of separase and Cdc55 is involved in regulating PP2A^Cdc55^ activity. The degradation of securin at anaphase onset might change the quality of this interaction, thereby initiating downregulation of PP2A^Cdc55^. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.523,t=0.740,r=0.905,b=0.941), with ID 9c0cb093-991a-4aee-af6c-79ee02b37777 -->

Summary : This figure investigates the regulation and activity of PP2A^Cdc55 phosphatase and its relationship to Cdc14 release during mitosis in yeast, using immunofluorescence microscopy, bar charts, line graphs, and immunoprecipitation-western blot analysis.

photo and data plots:

# A. Immunofluorescence Microscopy Images :
Scene Overview :
  • Shows yeast cells stained for DNA (DAPI, blue), Cdc55 (red), and Net1 (green).
  • Two time points: metaphase and 20 minutes after metaphase.
  • Cdc55 and Net1 localizations are compared at each stage.

Technical Details :
  • Three separate fluorescence channels per time point.
  • No scale bar visible; typical for yeast cell imaging.

Spatial Relationships :
  • DAPI (blue) marks nuclei.
  • Cdc55 (red) and Net1 (green) show distinct subcellular localizations.
  • Images are arranged left-to-right for each time point.

Analysis :
  • Cdc55 and Net1 localization patterns change between metaphase and 20 min post-metaphase, suggesting dynamic relocalization during mitotic progression.

# B. Bar and Line Graphs: PP2A^Cdc55 Activity and Cdc14 Release (Wild Type) :
Title & Axes :
  • Left two bar charts: "PP2A^Cdc55 specific activity" (Y-axis, %), X-axis: "time (min)" (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50).
  • Substrates: H1 (left), Net1 (middle).
  • Right line graph: "% of cells" (Y-axis) vs. "time (min)" (X-axis, 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50) for Cdc14 release.

Data Points :
  • H1 and Net1 bar charts: Both show a decrease in PP2A^Cdc55 activity from 0 to 20 min, then partial recovery by 50 min.
  • Cdc14 release line graph: % of cells with Cdc14 release peaks at 20 min (~80%), then declines.

Design Encodings :
  • Bar charts: dark gray bars, error bars shown.
  • Line graph: black circles with error bars.

Distribution & Trends :
  • PP2A^Cdc55 activity drops after metaphase, lowest at 20 min, then recovers.
  • Cdc14 release peaks at 20 min, coinciding with lowest PP2A^Cdc55 activity.

Analysis :
  • There is an inverse correlation between PP2A^Cdc55 activity and Cdc14 release during mitotic exit.

# C. Bar and Line Graphs: PP2A^Cdc55 Activity and Cdc14 Release (Wild Type vs. esp1-2 Mutant) :
Title & Axes :
  • Left bar chart: "PP2A^Cdc55 specific activity" (Y-axis, %), X-axis: "time (min)" (0, 10, 20, 30).
  • Two series: wt (wild type, dark gray), esp1-2 (light gray).
  • Right line graph: "% of cells" (Y-axis) vs. "time (min)" (X-axis, 0, 10, 20, 30) for Cdc14 release in wt and esp1-2.

Data Points :
  • Bar chart: wt shows a decrease in activity at 10–20 min, then partial recovery at 30 min; esp1-2 maintains higher activity throughout.
  • Line graph: wt shows a peak in Cdc14 release at 20 min (~60%), esp1-2 remains low (<20%).

Design Encodings :
  • Bar chart: two shades of gray for wt and esp1-2.
  • Line graph: filled circles (wt), open triangles (esp1-2), error bars present.

Distribution & Trends :
  • esp1-2 mutant fails to downregulate PP2A^Cdc55 activity and shows impaired Cdc14 release.

Analysis :
  • esp1-2 mutation disrupts the normal decrease in PP2A^Cdc55 activity and blocks efficient Cdc14 release.

# D. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot :
Scene Overview :
  • Western blots showing input and Cdc55 immunoprecipitation (IP) samples from metaphase (meta) and time points after release (10, 20, 30 min).
  • Probed for separase and Cdc55.
  • "untag" (untagged control) and "meta" (metaphase) lanes included.

Technical Details :
  • Bands for separase and Cdc55 are shown.
  • % anaphase spindles indicated below the blots for each time point (5, 60, 80, 20).

Spatial Relationships :
  • Input and IP samples are shown side-by-side for comparison.
  • Time course progression is left-to-right.

Analysis :
  • Separase co-immunoprecipitates with Cdc55 at metaphase and early anaphase, with signal decreasing at later time points.
  • The association between separase and Cdc55 correlates with mitotic progression and spindle dynamics.

# Analysis :
  • The figure demonstrates that PP2A^Cdc55 activity is downregulated during early anaphase, coinciding with Cdc14 release.
  • The esp1-2 mutant fails to downregulate PP2A^Cdc55 and does not efficiently release Cdc14, indicating separase is required for this regulation.
  • Immunoprecipitation data support a physical interaction between separase and Cdc55 that changes during mitotic progression.
  • The microscopy images visually confirm dynamic relocalization of Cdc55 and Net1 during mitosis. <!-- figure, from page 7 (l=0.169,t=0.122,r=0.810,b=0.665), with ID 4b626996-62a6-43ae-9872-1ceace974590 -->

Figure 5. Separase-Dependent PP2ACdc55 Downregulation at Anaphase Onset
(A) Cdc55 localization in the nucleolus. Strain Y2676 (MATa GAL-CDC20 HA3-CDC55 NET1-GFP) was arrested in metaphase by the depletion of Cdc20 and released into synchronous anaphase. Chromosome spreading was performed in metaphase, and 20 min after release, when 85% of cells were in anaphase as seen by tubulin staining.
(B) PP2ACdc55 downregulation at anaphase onset. Strain Y2521 (MATa GAL-CDC20 Pk3-CDC55 CDC14-HA6) was synchronized at the metaphase to anaphase transition. Phosphatase activity of immunopurified Cdc55 was measured as described in Experimental Procedures. Mean and standard deviations of the phosphatase-specific activity relative to metaphase in three experiments are given.
(C) Separase-dependent downregulation of PP2ACdc55 phosphatase activity. As (B), but strains Y2521 and Y2626 (as Y2521, but esp1-2) were synchronized at the metaphase to anaphase transition at 37°C.
(D) Separase and Cdc55 interact. Cell extracts were prepared from strains Y2063 (MATa GAL-CDC20 ESP1-HA6) and Y2499 (as Y2063, but also Pk3-CDC55) synchronized at the metaphase to anaphase transition, and coimmunoprecipitation of separase with Cdc55 was analyzed. Anaphase progression was monitored by tubulin staining. <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.095,t=0.675,r=0.887,b=0.825), with ID 4049f792-f12c-4c4a-8aa6-4b8649adb207 -->

PP2A^Cdc55^ and the Mitotic Exit Network  
It has recently been suggested that Cdc55 influences mitotic exit as part of MEN (Wang and Ng, 2006). In contrast, our results suggest that downregulation of PP2A^Cdc55^ allows Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation in metaphase before MEN becomes active. Furthermore, Cdc14 activation by ectopic separase expression is independent of the <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.095,t=0.838,r=0.478,b=0.943), with ID f4f2bd18-6ad2-4308-9326-8b4b7aba00ad -->

MEN kinase Cdc15 (Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003). To clarify whether MEN is required for Cdc14 nucleolar release in  
cdc554 cells, we synchronized cdc554 as well as cdc554  
cdc15-2 double mutant cells in G1 and followed them into  
a metaphase block at the restrictive temperature for  
cdc15-2 (Figure 6A). Cdc14 was released from the nucle-  
olus with similar timing in both strains. This indicates that <!-- text, from page 7 (l=0.504,t=0.838,r=0.887,b=0.944), with ID 144d081e-7af0-43ae-8189-8900bd3a5165 -->

# Analysis :

• In cdc15-2 cdc20Δ mutants, Cdc14 release is blocked, but budding proceeds, indicating a separation of these processes.
• Deletion of cdc55 (cdc55Δ) restores Cdc14 release even in the cdc15-2 cdc20Δ background, suggesting Cdc55 is a negative regulator of Cdc14 release.
• DNA content analysis shows progression from 2c to 1c, consistent with cell cycle progression and Cdc14 release.
• Immunoblot and quantification confirm that Cdc14 release is greatly increased in cdc55Δ mutants compared to wild type. <!-- figure, from page 8 (l=0.171,t=0.124,r=0.493,b=0.516), with ID 119e9945-343c-4208-888c-ac46618bbe11 -->

  • Two line plots (middle row) show "% of cells" (Y-axis) versus "time (min)" (X-axis: 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160).
  • Two series per plot: 
    – Filled circles: Cdc14 release.
    – X marks: endogenous securin.
  • Both genotypes show temporal changes in Cdc14 release and securin levels, with differences in timing and magnitude.

# Immunoblot Analysis :
  • Two sets of immunoblots (bottom row) for bub2Δ (left) and bub2Δ + securin^mdb (right).
  • Time points: meta, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180 min.
  • Probed proteins: Clb2 (upper band), Cdc28 (lower band).
  • Clb2 levels decrease over time; Cdc28 levels remain relatively constant.

# Design Encodings :
  • Flow cytometry: 3D line plots, black lines for each time point.
  • Quantification: filled circles and X marks for two series.
  • Immunoblots: horizontal bands, labeled for Clb2 and Cdc28.
  • Time course is synchronized across all panels.

# Analysis :
  • In bub2Δ cells, DNA content shifts from 2c to 1c over time, with a corresponding decrease in Clb2 and release of Cdc14.
  • In bub2Δ + securin^mdb cells, the shift from 2c to 1c is delayed or altered, with persistent securin and delayed Cdc14 release.
  • Clb2 degradation is delayed in the presence of securin^mdb, indicating a block or delay in mitotic exit.
  • Cdc28 levels remain stable, serving as a loading control.
  • The data suggest that nondegradable securin impairs timely mitotic exit in bub2Δ cells, as evidenced by delayed Cdc14 release and Clb2 degradation. <!-- figure, from page 8 (l=0.419,t=0.159,r=0.842,b=0.452), with ID 0f5cd18f-db49-4081-a211-e54ac715a6c8 -->

Cdc15, and therefore MEN, is not required for Cdc14 nucleolar release in response to Cdc55 inactivation. We confirmed that MEN was inactive in this experiment using the cdc15-2 control strain that remained arrested in telophase upon release from the metaphase block (data not shown). <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.116,t=0.658,r=0.493,b=0.730), with ID d5f825de-b0de-4b37-b6ef-1631051e3e35 -->

We next wanted to know whether MEN can activate
Cdc14 independently of separase. We ectopically acti-
vated MEN by deletion of Bub2, an inhibitor of the G pro-
tein Tem1 at the top of the MEN cascade. In metaphase
arrest by Cdc20 depletion, about 20% of bub2Δ cells
showed nucleolar release of Cdc14, compared to less
than 5% in wild-type cells under the same conditions
(Figure 6B, compare Figure 1A). This suggests that MEN
can activate Cdc14 in metaphase, but not very efficiently.
We then expressed securin^mdb before adding back
Cdc20, to keep separase inhibited while activating the
APC. Clb2 started to be degraded, Cdc14 was released,
and cells exited from mitosis, albeit with a delay compared
to cells without securin^mdb. Cdc14 release upon APC^Cdc20
activation suggests that MEN is inhibited by high Cdk ac- <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.117,t=0.729,r=0.494,b=0.940), with ID f84948ad-682a-4179-876b-831ef8dd8256 -->

tivity and becomes active as mitotic cyclins start to be de-
graded. Mitotic exit in the presence of securin^mdb^ further-
more suggests that Cdc14 activation by separase is no
longer needed if MEN is activated by deletion of Bub2.

In wild-type cells containing Bub2, however, separase
is indispensable for mitotic exit. This suggests that MEN
activation depends on separase. It has been proposed
that spindle elongation, as a consequence of separase-
triggered cohesin cleavage, activates MEN by bringing
spindle pole-associated Tem1 into contact with its activa-
tor Lte1 in the daughter cell (Bardin et al., 2000). However,
spindle elongation by TEV-protease-mediated chromo-
some segregation does not cause detectable Cdc14 nu-
cleolar release (Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003). Phosphory-
lation of Bfa1, that together with Bub2 inhibits Tem1, also
contributes to MEN activation (Hu et al., 2001; Pereira
et al., 2002). Bfa1 phosphorylation depends on Polo, and,
as with Net1, phosphorylation occurs in an anaphase-spe-
cific manner. As we could not find evidence for upregula-
tion of Polo activity during anaphase (data not shown), <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.524,t=0.658,r=0.903,b=0.940), with ID 28a0cc66-6335-4ac7-a657-6206db3336aa -->

  • No error bars or confidence intervals shown.

# Distribution & Trends :
  • In panel B (wild type exit):
    – Cdc14 shows a sharp peak around 30 min, then declines.
    – Cdc20 rises early, peaks, then falls.
    – Cdh1 rises after Cdc14 peaks.
    – Clb2 declines steadily.
    – MEN rises and falls in synchrony with Cdc14.
    – Net1-P rises then falls as Cdc14 peaks.
    – PP2A drops sharply as Net1-P rises.
    – Securin and separase show reciprocal trends: securin falls as separase rises.
  • In panel C (MEN inactive):
    – Cdc14 remains low and does not peak.
    – Cdc20 rises and falls similarly to panel B.
    – Cdh1 remains low.
    – Clb2 declines more slowly.
    – Net1-P remains high.
    – PP2A remains high.
    – Securin remains high; separase remains low.

# Analysis :
  • In wild type exit (panel B), coordinated changes in Cdc14, MEN, and other regulators drive a sharp mitotic exit transition, with Cdc14 peaking and triggering downstream events (Cdh1 activation, securin degradation, separase activation).
  • In MEN inactive cells (panel C), Cdc14 fails to peak, Cdh1 is not activated, and securin is not degraded, indicating a block in mitotic exit.
  • The plots visually demonstrate the requirement of MEN for proper Cdc14 activation and mitotic exit, as well as the interdependence of these regulatory proteins. <!-- figure, from page 9 (l=0.093,t=0.399,r=0.604,b=0.783), with ID 3568fb13-c451-4790-a838-8670e044c4ca -->

A Quantitative Model for Mitotic Exit  
At anaphase onset, separase is activated to trigger sister chromatid separation. At the same time the phosphatase Cdc14 is released from inhibition in the nucleolus. We now suggest a mechanism by which these two events are linked. Separase-dependent downregulation of PP2A^Cdc55^ activity facilitates Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation. This finding, together with results of previous studies, allows us to outline a quantitative model for mitotic exit in budding yeast (Figure 7A). <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.097,t=0.798,r=0.476,b=0.941), with ID fed87717-d322-48eb-b8ad-e4b89e13bab1 -->

At the heart of the model lies reversible phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Net1, catalyzed by Cdk and MEN kinases, and PP2A^Cdc55^ and Cdc14 phosphatases (in addition to PP2A^Cdc55^, Cdc14 itself contributes to Net1 dephosphorylation; Jaspersen and Morgan, 2000; Shou et al., 1999). Once active, Cdc14 dephosphorylates Cdc15, contributing to MEN activation. In a positive feedback loop, MEN causes further Net1 phosphorylation and Cdc14 release (Stegmeier et al., 2002). To avoid premature activation, this positive feedback loop is tightly regulated by Cdk and PP2A^Cdc55^. While PP2A^Cdc55^ inhibits Cdc14 release, Cdk has both activatory (Net1 phosphorylation) and inhibitory (Cdc15 phosphorylation) roles in Cdc14 release. The ratio of Cdc14 versus Cdk activity is read out by both MEN and the bistable Cdk-Cdh1 switch (Novak et al., 1998). The molecular network underlying this model is shown in Figure 7A (and Figure S6) and was converted into differential equations (Figure S6). Kinetic parameters were estimated by fitting numerical simulations <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.507,t=0.673,r=0.884,b=0.940), with ID e61e94b0-fc0b-4c06-8b75-ceb66ce8d991 -->

to experimental data. Bifurcation analysis shows that the
model has three stable states corresponding to meta-
phase (high Cdk, low Cdc14), telophase (high Cdk and
high Cdc14, Cdh1 inactive), and G1 (low Cdk and low
Cdc14, Cdh1 active) for a wide range of parameters. The
model accurately describes all our experimental data, as
well as key observations in the published literature (Fig-
ures 7B and 7C and Figure S6). <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.114,t=0.125,r=0.495,b=0.239), with ID c61f46dd-56d4-4a9d-beae-0d9e535a0767 -->

Preparation for mitotic exit already starts in metaphase
by Cdk-dependent phosphorylation of Net1. However,
this is counteracted by PP2A^Cdc55^. Absence of Cdc55
leads to premature nucleolar release and activation of
Cdc14, yet exit from mitosis is blocked as long as
APC^Cdc20^ is kept inactive. During a normal cell cycle
Cdc14 is activated when APC^Cdc20^ promotes degradation
of securin, releasing separase to downregulate PP2A^Cdc55^
(Figure 7B). <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.115,t=0.239,r=0.495,b=0.365), with ID 37706cf2-0c00-44b8-aec1-07beaa303613 -->

Further progression of mitotic exit requires APC^Cdc20^-
dependent cyclin destruction. If cyclin is nondegradable,
cells arrest in telophase, in a cell-cycle state similar to
Cdc20-deprived cdc55Δ cells. Cdc14 is active but per-
sisting Cdk activity blocks mitotic exit. If APC^Cdc20^ pro-
motes degradation of Clb2, but MEN is inactive, Cdk
activity is reduced to roughly half of the metaphase value
(Yeong et al., 2000). In these cells, Cdc14 release be-
comes transient (Stegmeier et al., 2002), proportional to
declining Cdk activity that is no longer sufficient to sustain
Net1 phosphorylation (Figure 7C). Thereby, the ratio of
Cdc14 to Cdk remains roughly constant. Cells reach a
stable state, similar to the telophase state but with halfway
lowered Clb2 levels, little Cdc14 released, and inactive
Cdh1. <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.115,t=0.365,r=0.495,b=0.574), with ID 14a013f9-a057-4ca2-8a73-6557023e91b1 -->

To complete mitotic exit, Cdc14 must remain active
while Cdk activity is downregulated. This requires Cdk-
independent Net1 phosphorylation, provided by MEN
(Figure 7B). The mechanism of MEN activation, and
whether MEN kinases directly phosphorylate Net1, is not
fully understood. Cdc14 activates MEN at the level of
Cdc15. We suggest that Bfa1 phosphorylation after
PP2A^Cdc55 downregulation provides additional ana-
phase-specific activation of MEN. Once MEN is engaged,
cells can lower Clb2 levels while maintaining Cdc14 activ-
ity, reaching the critical Cdc14/Cdk ratio for Cdh1 activa-
tion. This completely turns off Cdk activity, arriving at a sta-
ble G1 state that no longer requires Cdc14. Persisting
Cdc14 activity would indeed compromise entry into the
next cell cycle, so MEN and Cdc14 themselves must be
switched off. This might be achieved by APC^Cdh1-depen-
dent degradation of the MEN component Polo. <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.116,t=0.575,r=0.495,b=0.815), with ID be1c3f05-519f-4ea6-ad04-a906b80f3a8e -->

DISCUSSION

Cdc14 Early Anaphase Release
Separase-dependent nucleolar release of Cdc14 has first been described in context of the FEAR network to explain Cdc14 release in early anaphase (Stegmeier et al., 2002).
The significance of separase in Cdc14 activation has been underestimated. This stems largely from the fact that the <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.115,t=0.825,r=0.495,b=0.942), with ID cbcf2e9d-42a7-43ba-a95f-a1f2e6529e56 -->

mutant alleles of separase so far employed did not reflect
a complete loss of function. We now show that if separase
activity is further reduced, an essential role in Cdc14 acti-
vation and mitotic exit is uncovered. Separase is required
to reduce PP2A^Cdc55 phosphatase activity against Net1,
thereby facilitating Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation
at anaphase onset. PP2A^Cdc55 downregulation may fur-
thermore contribute to MEN activation. The mechanistic
basis for separase-dependent PP2A^Cdc55 downregulation
remains to be elucidated; it could involve a direct interac-
tion between the two proteins. It also remains to be inves-
tigated whether Net1 is a direct target for PP2A^Cdc55. Its
localization in the nucleolus is certainly consistent with
this possibility. <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.524,t=0.126,r=0.903,b=0.323), with ID 655b3991-9468-40b6-bd0c-a76091251ff5 -->

Slk19 and Spo12 are two proteins that contribute to
separase-induced Cdc14 activation in early anaphase
and have been described as part of the FEAR network.
Unlike separase, neither is essential. Slk19 influences
separase localization during anaphase and could thus, in
an indirect manner, alter separase’s ability to promote
PP2A^Cdc55 downregulation (Sullivan et al., 2001). Spo12
is present in the nucleolus where it interacts with the
rDNA replication fork barrier protein Fob1 (Stegmeier
et al., 2004). Fob1 binding overlaps with Net1 on the
rDNA, so Spo12 or Fob1 could affect accessibility of
Net1 to kinases or phosphatases. <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.524,t=0.323,r=0.903,b=0.491), with ID f1754261-fee9-4d8e-9a6c-ceb81aa8d55c -->

Mutation of six Net1 Cdk phosphorylation sites also
leads to a delay, but not block, of Cdc14 activation (Azzam
et al., 2004). This indicates that Cdk-dependent Cdc14 re-
lease may be dispensable if MEN provides Cdk-indepen-
dent Net1 phosphorylation. On the other hand, we found
that Cdk activity is essential for exit from mitosis. This
could be because the net1-6Cdk mutation did not abolish
all Net1 Cdk phosphorylation and at least a low level of
Cdk-dependent Cdc14 activation is necessary. Alterna-
tively, Cdk could play an additional role in MEN activation,
e.g., by maintaining the activity of Polo (Mortensen et al.,
2005). The essential role of separase in mitotic exit could
likewise have two reasons. Separase-induced, Cdk-de-
pendent Cdc14 release could be essential to initiate the
positive feedback loop of MEN activation. Alternatively,
Cdk-dependent Net1 phosphorylation and early Cdc14
release is entirely dispensable, but in its absence sepa-
rase-dependent MEN activation via Bfa1 phosphorylation
may become essential. A possible contribution of sepa-
rase-dependent spindle elongation has yet to be rigorously
assessed. A separase mutant devoid of protease activity,
which fails to promote cohesin cleavage and spindle elon-
gation, is still proficient in promoting mitotic exit in the
separase degron mutant background (data not shown). <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.524,t=0.491,r=0.905,b=0.827), with ID bc8e9f63-1d45-446b-bd39-f8c67ba71ae7 -->

Polo is an essential MEN component (Jaspersen et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2001) and has also been implicated in separase-induced early Cdc14 activation (Stegmeier et al., 2002; Sullivan and Uhlmann, 2003). The contribution to early Cdc14 release was seen after Polo inactivation early in the cell cycle. When we inactivated Polo specifically at the time of anaphase onset we could no longer detect a contribution to separase-induced Cdc14 activation. <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.525,t=0.828,r=0.904,b=0.940), with ID 78bc119d-8358-4bee-a5d7-001dca6cabdf -->

As Polo is thought to promote the build-up of Cdk activity during mitotic entry, it might be that early Polo inactivation leads to compromised early Cdc14 release as a consequence of attenuated Cdk activation. <!-- text, from page 11 (l=0.095,t=0.124,r=0.477,b=0.185), with ID d7b61e01-5036-4509-bebc-78a981656138 -->

Separase and Mitotic Exit in Higher Eukaryotes
While Cdc14 is tightly regulated and essential for mitotic exit in budding yeast, this is not true for its orthologs in fission yeast and C. elegans (Cueille et al., 2001; Saito et al., 2004). In principle, mitotic exit can be brought about by Cdk downregulation against a constant background of unregulated phosphatase(s), and we cannot exclude that this is the case in most organisms. An important difference in budding yeast concerns the regulation of mitotic entry, in particular in response to DNA damage. DNA damage activates checkpoint kinases that in most organisms prevent entry into mitosis by stabilizing inhibitory Cdk tyrosine phosphorylation. Cells arrest in G2, well before entry into mitosis. Budding yeast, in contrast, enter mitosis after DNA damage and arrest with active Cdk and active APCCdc20. Mitotic arrest depends on checkpoint kinase-dependent phosphorylation of securin, preventing its destruction by APCCdc20 (Wang et al., 2001). Thus, securin maintains a stable mitotic state, and keeping Cdk counteracting phosphatase activity low is crucial for this arrest to be robust. While metaphase arrest in response to DNA damage is prominent in budding yeast, the underlying pathway may be preserved in other eukaryotes. A cryptic metaphase arrest has been documented after replication fork blockage during fission yeast meiosis (Murakami and Nurse, 1999). <!-- text, from page 11 (l=0.095,t=0.194,r=0.477,b=0.561), with ID 3bafa35b-a256-417e-806f-36e65f07477a -->

Controlled phosphatase activation at anaphase onset
may provide further advantages for mitotic regulation.
For example, anaphase onset coincides with a sudden
change in microtubule dynamics in many organisms, im-
portant for successful chromosome segregation (Higuchi
and Uhlmann, 2005). In budding yeast, Cdc14 activation
regulates this change. Release of a phosphatase has the
potential to cause abrupt change in the phosphorylation
status of a substrate, compared to the slower process of
Cdk downregulation against constitutive phosphatases. <!-- text, from page 11 (l=0.095,t=0.562,r=0.476,b=0.702), with ID e048b4c9-e688-470f-84a2-1731a353be5d -->

Mutations in Drosophila separase uncovered a distinct, albeit short, delay in mitotic exit (Pandey et al., 2005). Meanwhile human separase, after securin destruction, directly interacts with Cdk and inhibits the kinase molecules it has bound to (Gorr et al., 2005). This suggests that aspects of mitotic exit regulation by separase are conserved. Another similarity may exist in separase’s interaction with PP2A. We found protein levels of Cdc55 reduced in separase mutant cells. Reduced PP2ACdc55 in turn leads to increased inhibitory Cdk phosphorylation by Swe1 kinase, a phenotype also observed in human cells containing mutant separase (Papi et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2000). Cdc55 instability in the absence of separase could be due to the missing protein interaction. It will be interesting to see whether separase/Cdc55 interaction and regulation during anaphase are conserved. Our study provides insight into how separase couples cohesin cleavage at anaphase <!-- text, from page 11 (l=0.096,t=0.701,r=0.477,b=0.942), with ID 7c0b4876-2b33-42b4-86c2-4058396f0121 -->

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Yeast Strains and Plasmids
All strains were derivatives of W303. Epitope tagging of endogenous genes and gene deletions were performed by gene targeting using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products (Knop et al., 1999). The esp1-2td allele was created by cloning a 525 nucleotide PCR fragment of the ESP1 promoter and 400 nucleotides of the first ESP1 open reading frame into plasmid pWD68 (Dohmen et al., 1994). The plasmid was integrated after linearization with Msc I into esp1-2 strains (Buonomo et al., 2000), harboring plasmid pKL59 (GAL1-UBR1, a gift from K. La- bib). For N-terminal tagging of endogenous CDC55, fragments of the CDC55 promoter from −500 and of the first 178 nucleotides of the CDC55 open reading frame were generated by PCR and introduced into plasmid pRS306. Epitope tags were inserted in front of the open reading frame, and plasmids were integrated into the yeast genome after linearization with Msc I. CDC28Y19F mutant strains were created by integration, and loop out by 5-FOA selection, of the linearized pJM1054 plasmid, a gift from D.J. Lew (McMillan et al., 1999). The securinmdb strains were created by integration of plasmid pOC70, a gift from O. Cohen-Fix (Cohen-Fix and Koshland, 1999). The expression of separase to trigger anaphase in cells arrested in metaphase by Cdc20 depletion was described previously (Uhlmann et al., 2000). Cell synchronization using α factor and metaphase arrest by Cdc20 depletion and release into synchronous anaphase were as described (Uhlmann et al., 1999). <!-- text, from page 11 (l=0.504,t=0.169,r=0.886,b=0.489), with ID 849aa713-fa4d-4a3c-a700-e57e6fd714dd -->

Immunoprecipitation, Clb2/Cdk Kinase Assay,  
and PP2ACdc55 Phosphatase Assay  
Protein extracts were prepared after spheroplast lysis as described (Uhlmann et al., 1999). For immunoprecipitation, the clarified extracts were precleared with protein A sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with antibody, and immunocomplexes were bound to protein A dynabeads (Dynal). Beads were washed and boiled with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. For the kinase assay, the beads were washed twice more with kinase buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM β-glycero-phosphate). Beads were incubated with 20 μl reaction mix (kinase buffer supplemented with 50 μM ATP and 2.5 μg H1 [Roche], or 10 μM ATP and 1 μg of purified recombinant Net1 [1–600], both including 0.25 μCi/μl γ-32P-ATP) for 20 min at 30°C and the reactions were stopped by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer. H1 and Net1 phosphorylation was detected by autoradiography and quantified using a PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics). For the phosphatase assays, H1 and Net1 (1–600) were phosphorylated as above, but the incubation was extended to 1 hr. Substrates were purified away from unincorporated nucleotides by gel filtration using Sephadex G-50 Nick columns (Amersham Biosciences). N-terminally His6 epitope-tagged Cdc55 was immunopurified on protein A dynabeads as above, and the beads were washed with phosphatase buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin [Sigma], 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol). Reaction mix (1 μg 32P-phospho-H1, 0.5 μg 32P-phospho-Net1 [1–600], in 50 μl phosphatase buffer) was added to the beads and incubated at 30°C for 20 min. Reactions were terminated on ice, protein was precipitated from the supernatants with 16% trichloroacetic acid, and acid-soluble 32P-phosphate was quantified in a scintillation counter. Cdc55 recovered on the beads was analyzed by Western blotting using an IRdye 800 coupled secondary antibody and detected by Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). <!-- text, from page 11 (l=0.505,t=0.498,r=0.887,b=0.890), with ID ec76cbec-9939-4d3d-b91f-c6cc6ddd6b0b -->
