/* Notes:
- This model encodes the network topology described in Strasen et al. (2018): ligand binding and receptor activation, internalization-driven ligand depletion, SMAD2 phosphorylation, SMAD4 complex formation, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, nuclear dephosphorylation/export, and transcriptional negative feedback (e.g., SMAD7) acting at the receptor level. Feedback inhibition is implemented as a divisive term in the phosphorylation rate.
- Quantitative parameter values were not provided in the input text; default placeholder values are assigned to allow simulation. Replace these with fitted values as needed (see BioModels MODEL1712050001?MODEL17120500012 referenced in the article).
- Initial extracellular ligand (L) is set to 25 (arbitrary units) to reflect typical stimuli (1?100 pM in the experiments). Adjust to desired stimulus levels. */
