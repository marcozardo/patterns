  //// Compartments and Species:
  compartment body;
  species N in body, C in body, B in body;

  //// Assignment Rules:
  T := N + C;
  r_C := rho_C + b * (T - K_N)^2 / (a * T^2 + (T - K_N)^2);

  //// Rate Rules:
  N' = -r_N * N * ln((N + C) / K_N);
  C' = -r_C * C * ln((N + C) / K_C);
  B' = r_B * B - gamma_B * B * (C / (k_B + C));

  //// Reactions:
  // No traditional biochemical reactions - dynamics captured by rate rules

  //// Events:
  // No events defined in the source literature

  //// Species initializations:
