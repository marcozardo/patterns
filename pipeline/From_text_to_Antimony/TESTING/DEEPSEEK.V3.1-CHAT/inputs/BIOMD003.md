ABSTRACT      A minimal model for the mitotic oscillator is
presented. The model, built on recent experimental advances,
is based on the cascade of post-translational modification that
modulates the activity of cdc2 kinase during the cell cycle. The
model pertains to the situation encountered in early amphibian
embryos, where the accumulation of cyclin suffices to trigger
the onset of mitosis. In the first cycle of the bicyclic cascade
model, cyclin promotes the activation of cdc2 kinase through
reversible dephosphorylation, and in the second cycle, cdc2
kinase activates a cyclin protease by reversible phosphoryla-
tion. That cyclin activates cdc2 kinase while the kinase triggers
the degradation of cyclin has suggested that oscillations may
originate from such a negative feedback loop [Félix, M. A.,
Labbé, J. C., Dorée, M., Hunt, T. & Karsenti, E. (1990)
Nature (London) 346, 379-382]. This conjecture is corrobo-
rated by the model, which indicates that sustained oscillations
of the limit cycle type can arise in the cascade, provided that a
threshold exists in the activation of cdc2 kinase by cyclin and
in the activation of cyclin proteolysis by cdc2 kinase. The
analysis shows how mitotic oscillations may readily arise from
time lags associated with these thresholds and from the delayed
negative feedback provided by cdc2-induced cyclin degrada-
tion. A mechanism for the origin of the thresholds is proposed
in terms of the phenomenon of zero-order ultrasensitivity
previously described for biochemical systems regulated by
covalent modification. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.240,r=0.493,b=0.580), with ID 962c5b14-ea3e-447e-a9b3-89628b6188f7 -->

Recent advances in the characterization of the biochemical
events underlying the cell cycle point to the existence of a
universal mechanism regulating the onset of mitosis. Con-
vergent results from studies on yeast (1) and embryonic cells
(2) indicate that the various processes which bring about
mitosis, such as breakdown of the nuclear envelope, chro-
mosome condensation, or spindle assembly, are triggered by
the periodic activation of a protein kinase, product of the
gene cdc2 in fission yeast or of its homologs in other
eukaryotes (1-4). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.087,t=0.594,r=0.487,b=0.723), with ID 14210d01-8ff3-4d23-9418-73ac419d1a52 -->

The simplest form of mitotic trigger mechanism is found in
early amphibian embryos, where the accumulation of a
protein signal, named cyclin because of its periodic variation
(5), suffices to drive the cell cycle (2, 6, 7): as cyclin
progressively increases beyond a threshold, it causes the
activation of cdc2 kinase with which it forms a complex,
referred to as maturation- or M-phase-promoting factor
(MPF). The latter complex triggers mitosis as well as cyclin
degradation (8); the subsequent inactivation of cdc2 kinase
resets the cell for a new division cycle (2, 6-8). In yeast as
well as in somatic cells, the mechanism involves additional
checkpoints (1, 9). What remains common to the various
types of cell cycle mechanisms, however, is the fact that they
rely on the periodic activation of cdc2 kinase (1-4). Control <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.085,t=0.724,r=0.483,b=0.901), with ID a4d33afc-c59a-4dcd-9916-edce0d5b5f5b -->

of the kinase is achieved by reversible covalent modification: activation of cdc2 kinase before the onset of mitosis involves its dephosphorylation, whereas the enzyme is inactivated after mitosis through rephosphorylation (10–15). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.525,t=0.241,r=0.927,b=0.294), with ID 7c03f03d-f751-40d0-817c-593692432ba2 -->

What is the molecular mechanism whereby the activation
of cdc2 kinase occurs in a periodic manner? The fact that in
extracts of amphibian eggs cyclin accumulation drives the
activation of cdc2 kinase while the latter promotes cyclin
degradation suggests that a minimum cell-cycle oscillator
might be based on such a negative feedback loop (2, 8, 16).
On the other hand, thresholds are often invoked for the
activation of cdc2 kinase by cyclin (1-4, 8, 14) and for the
rapid degradation of cyclin after mitosis (7, 8, 16); the origin
of such thresholds, however, remains unclear. The purpose
of the present work is to show, by means of a simple
theoretical model, how thresholds in cdc2 kinase activation
and in cyclin degradation may naturally arise as a result of
post-translational modification, and how the mitotic cascade
involving cyclin and cdc2 kinase can oscillate as a result of
both the time delays associated with these thresholds and the
triggering by cdc2 kinase of rapid cyclin degradation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.524,t=0.296,r=0.924,b=0.518), with ID 75c144d5-0bfd-4437-8cb0-9e50f18438e8 -->

Although the model is based on a number of simplifying
assumptions, its analysis highlights the conditions in which the
cyclin–cdc2 kinase system can operate as a continuous au-
tonomous oscillator. Besides the situation encountered in
early embryogenesis, the results also bear on the more com-
plex mechanisms that control the cell cycle in yeast and
somatic cells. By pinpointing ways in which oscillations might
be arrested, the model suggests how the products of other
genes could play a role in inducing or suppressing mitosis,
through the positive or negative regulation of various steps in
the cascade that modulates the activity of cdc2 kinase. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.521,t=0.518,r=0.921,b=0.667), with ID 58867913-c131-4bce-b8ec-c79ce835b3cf -->

Minimal Cascade Model Involving Cyclin and cdc2 Kinase

So as to deal with the minimal structure of the mitotic oscillator, the present analysis focuses on the cell cycle in early amphibian embryos, where the two main actors are cyclin and cdc2 kinase (2, 6–8). The basic assumption (see Fig. 1) is that cyclin is synthesized at a constant rate and triggers the activation of cdc2 kinase. The mechanism of this regulation is not fully understood and is currently the subject of active investigation (1–4, 10–15, 17–20). It appears that cdc2 kinase is inactivated by phosphorylation on a tyrosine (and possibly a threonine) residue located in the ATP-binding domain; dephosphorylation of these residues results in activation of the enzyme (1–4, 13, 15), but the phosphorylation of another (probably threonine) residue might be required for full activity (14, 15). The initial, inactivating, phosphorylation as well as the subsequent activation of cdc2 kinase appears to follow the formation of a complex with cyclin (21). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.516,t=0.680,r=0.916,b=0.911), with ID 24660503-cc9f-4f6b-b1db-29bc999085ae -->

keep the model simple and to allow for the straightforward
generation of thresholds (see below), the formation of a
complex between cyclin and cdc2 kinase will not be taken into
account; instead, it is assumed that cyclin drives cdc2 activa-
tion by enhancing the velocity of an “activase” which (see the
above discussion) might primarily represent a tyrosine (and,
possibly, threonine) phosphatase. Such a direct activation of
the phosphatase acting on phosphorylated cdc2 kinase is one
of the hypothetical mechanisms originally put forward for
cyclin action (7, 22). A further assumption is that the maximum
activity of the kinase inactivating cdc2—the cdc2 “inactivase”
(7)—remains constant throughout the cell cycle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.079,t=0.398,r=0.487,b=0.561), with ID 2ebc6f4a-4f2a-48e9-b09c-9cf7d885198d -->

That okadaic acid, an inhibitor of phosphatase 2A, behaves
as a mitotic inducer has suggested that the phosphatase acting
on cdc2 might be activated through phosphorylation and inactivated by phosphatase 2A (23-26). This minimal model will not
take into account the possible modification of the activase, nor
will it differentiate the roles of cyclins A and B, which appear
to cooperate in the activation of cdc2 kinase (27, 28). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.080,t=0.562,r=0.487,b=0.655), with ID 3a2b6474-a7f8-48da-9a4a-6bfe1e2ce59d -->

In line with the observation that the kinase activity of the
cdc2 protein promotes cyclin degradation (8, it is assumed
that cdc2 kinase activates a cyclin protease, designated as X
(as in ref. 8), by reversible phosphorylation (Fig. 1); the
maximum activity of the phosphatase inactivating that pro-
tease is taken as constant throughout the cycle. There is
evidence that the pathway of cyclin degradation is itself a
bicyclic phosphorylation cascade, the first step of which
would be controlled by cdc2 kinase (8, 16, 25, 26). Consid-
eration of a multicyclic rather than monocyclic cascade
leading to the activation of the protease by cdc2 kinase
would, however, not significantly affect the results presented
here. Cyclin was recently shown to be degraded by the
ubiquitin pathway (29); activation of cyclin degradation by
cdc2 kinase could accordingly result from the phosphoryla-
tion of a protein that would promote the conjugation
of ubiquitin to cyclin, leading to rapid cyclin destruction
(29). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.082,t=0.654,r=0.488,b=0.892), with ID 3e5a467a-d42b-4f85-9255-94108d2f90cf -->

Thus, the three variables of the minimal model are cyclin,
the active (i.e., dephosphorylated) form of cdc2 kinase, and
the active (i.e., phosphorylated) form of cyclin protease. The

In the above equations, C denotes the cyclin concentra-
tion, while M and X represent the fraction of active cdc2
kinase and the fraction of active cyclin protease; (1 - M) thus
represents the fraction of inactive (i.e., phosphorylated) cdc2
kinase, while (1 - X) represents the fraction of inactive (i.e.,
dephosphorylated) cyclin protease. As to parameters, vi and
vd denote, respectively, the constant rate of cyclin synthesis
and the maximum rate of cyclin degradation by protease X
reached for X = 1; Kd and Kc denote the Michaelis constants
for cyclin degradation and for cyclin activation of the phos-
phatase acting on the phosphorylated form of cdc2 kinase; kd
represents an apparent first-order rate constant related to
nonspecific degradation of cyclin (this facultative reaction,
whose contribution is much smaller than that of cyclin
degradation by protease X, is not needed for oscillations; its
sole effect is to prevent the boundless increase of cyclin in
conditions where the specific protease would be inhibited). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.512,t=0.280,r=0.921,b=0.510), with ID 8be0357a-b6ce-4bb9-97c5-578aa7cf20e3 -->

The normalized parameters $V_i$ and $K_i$ ($i = 1$–$4$) characterize the kinetics of the enzymes $E_i$ ($i = 1$–$4$) involved in the two cycles of post-translational modification: on one hand, the phosphatase ($E_1$) and the kinase ($E_2$) acting on the cdc2 molecule, and on the other hand, the cdc2 kinase ($E_3$) and the phosphatase ($E_4$) acting on the cyclin protease (see Fig. 1). For each converter enzyme, the two parameters $V_i$ and $K_i$ are the effective maximum rate and the Michaelis constant, divided by the total amount of relevant target protein—i.e., $M_T$ (total amount of cdc2 kinase) for enzymes $E_1$ and $E_2$, and $X_T$ (total amount of cyclin protease) for enzymes $E_3$ and $E_4$; both $M_T$ (4, 11, 12) and $X_T$ will be considered as constant throughout the cell cycle. The expressions for the effective maximum rates $V_1$ and $V_3$ are given by Eq. 2. These expressions reflect the assumption that cyclin activates phosphatase $E_1$ in a Michaelian manner; $V_{M1}$ denotes the maximum rate of that enzyme reached at saturating cyclin levels. On the other hand, the effective maximum rate of cdc2 kinase is proportional to the fraction of active enzyme; $V_{M3}$ denotes the maximum velocity of the kinase reached for $M = 1$. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.512,t=0.509,r=0.921,b=0.774), with ID 5bdde967-b10a-4d98-a18c-0ded591c90a6 -->

All nonlinearities in the model are of the Michaelian type.
In other words, no form of positive cooperativity is assumed,
neither in the proteolysis of cyclin or in the activation by
cyclin of the phosphatase acting on cdc2 nor in any of the
reactions of covalent modification. The self-amplification
effect due to the possible activation of cdc2 kinase by the
active form of the cdc2 product (2, 14) has not been consid-
ered (see Discussion). One of the main goals of the present
analysis is, indeed, to determine whether oscillations can
arise solely as a result of the negative feedback provided by
cdc2-induced cyclin degradation and of the thresholds and
time delays built into the cyclin–cdc2 cascade of covalent
modification. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.513,t=0.774,r=0.922,b=0.947), with ID 1f286fe5-914b-4a3b-b185-015d40417e53 -->

Thresholds and Time Delays Arising from Post-

Of key importance for oscillations in the model is the existence of sharp thresholds both in the triggering by cyclin of cdc2 kinase activation through dephosphorylation and in the triggering by cdc2 kinase of cyclin degradation. In the absence of any form of allosteric cooperativity, such thresholds arise naturally in the model from the phenomenon of zero-order ultrasensitivity previously described for covalent modification (30). The basic feature of this phenomenon is that the dependence of the fraction of protein modified (e.g., phosphorylated) at steady state varies in a very steep manner as a function of the ratio of kinase to phosphatase maximum rates when the two converter enzymes possess relatively low Michaelis constants and therefore function in the zero-order kinetic domain. The existence of thresholds associated with zero-order ultrasensitivity has been predicted theoretically (30, 31) and verified experimentally in several enzymatic systems controlled by covalent modification, such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (32) and glycogen phosphorylase (33). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.103,t=0.107,r=0.504,b=0.336), with ID 45903573-f13d-44db-8fb7-9995f36cdc7e -->

The occurrence of such thresholds in the mitotic cascade
model is illustrated by the curves showing the dependence at
steady state of the fraction of active cdc2 kinase on cyclin
(Fig. 2A) and of the fraction of active cyclin protease on cdc2
kinase (Fig. 2B). When the value of the reduced Michaelis
constants $K_i$ ($i = 1$–$4$) is significantly smaller than unity, the
variation of $M$ and $X$ as a function of the ratio of effective
maximum modification rates ($V_1/V_2$) or ($V_3/V_4$) is extremely
steep (curves a in Fig. 2). In contrast, the transition curves for <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.101,t=0.337,r=0.500,b=0.452), with ID f2e65e5d-59bf-4913-8e29-57478799a2b9 -->

_M_ and _X_ become much smoother, and finally acquire a  
hyperbolic nature, as the constants _K_<sub>i</sub> increase up to and  
above unity (curves b in Fig. 2). The values of _C_ and _M_  
corresponding to the thresholds in the activation of _M_ and _X_  
(see curves a in Fig. 2) will be referred to as _C_* and _M_*. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.099,t=0.450,r=0.498,b=0.513), with ID 2867199d-880e-496b-9514-ce423041ac1e -->

Also essential for the onset of oscillations in the model are
time delays whose existence is closely correlated with the
occurrence of the steep transitions in M and X. A first delay
indeed originates from the slow accumulation of cyclin up to
the threshold value C*, beyond which the fraction of active
cdc2 kinase abruptly increases up to a value close to unity
(see curve a in Fig. 2A). A second delay comes from the time
required for M to reach the threshold M*, beyond which the
cyclin protease is switched on (curve a in Fig. 2B). Moreover,
the transitions in M and X do not occur instantaneously once
C and M reach the threshold values predicted by the steady-
state curves; the time lag in each of the two modification
processes contributes to the delay that separates the rise in
C from the increase in M and the latter increase from the rise
in X. Finally, the mirror time lag on the decreasing phase of
M and X is no less important: the fact that the cyclin protease
is not directly inactivated when the level of cyclin drops
below C* prolongs the phase of cyclin degradation, with the
consequence that M and X will both become inactivated to a
further degree as C drops well below C*. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.095,t=0.513,r=0.495,b=0.767), with ID 5e9c8b2f-eb13-428d-8e50-15a2400ac39b -->

Oscillatory Dynamics of the Bicyclic Cascade Involving
Cyclin and cdc2 Kinase

Provided that thresholds exist in the dependence of M on C
and of X on M, as for curves a in Fig. 2, the evolution of the
bicyclic cascade readily proceeds in a periodic manner (Fig.
3). Starting from a small value of C corresponding to a low
initial concentration of cyclin, the latter accumulates at a
constant rate due to protein synthesis; during that phase,
both M and X have a small value, since C is well below the
threshold of activation of M and, consequently, M is well
below the threshold of activation of X. As the cyclin level
continues to rise, the value of C approaches the sharp

Summary : This figure presents two line plots showing the dependence of the fraction of active cdc2 kinase (M) on cyclin concentration (C), and the fraction of active cyclin protease (X) on the fraction of active cdc2 kinase (M), under different parameter regimes.

line plots:
# Panel A: Fraction of active cdc2 kinase vs. Cyclin concentration
Title & Axes :
  • No explicit panel title, but contextually: "Fraction of active cdc2 kinase, M, as a function of Cyclin, C (µM)".
  • X-axis: "Cyclin, C (µM)", tick labels: 0, 1, 2, 3.
  • Y-axis: "Fraction of active cdc2 kinase, M", tick labels: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0.
Data Points :
  • Two curves labeled "a" and "b".
  • Curve "a": Steep sigmoidal increase, reaching near-maximal M at lower C.
  • Curve "b": More gradual, less steep increase, saturating at a lower maximal M.
  • Arrow labeled "C*" on the x-axis, indicating a threshold or critical cyclin concentration.
Design Encodings :
  • Both curves are solid black lines; curve "a" is steeper than "b".
  • No markers, error bars, or colour coding.
Distribution & Trends :
  • Curve "a" shows a sharp threshold-like activation of cdc2 kinase with increasing cyclin.
  • Curve "b" shows a more graded response.
  
# Panel B: Fraction of active cyclin protease vs. Fraction of active cdc2 kinase
Title & Axes :
  • No explicit panel title, but contextually: "Fraction of active cyclin protease, X, as a function of Fraction of active cdc2 kinase, M".
  • X-axis: "Fraction of active cdc2 kinase, M", tick labels: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0.
  • Y-axis: "Fraction of active cyclin protease, X", tick labels: 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0.
Data Points :
  • Two curves labeled "a" and "b".
  • Curve "a": Steep sigmoidal increase in X as M increases, with a sharp threshold.
  • Curve "b": Gradual, nearly linear increase in X with M.
  • Arrow labeled "M*" on the x-axis, indicating a threshold or critical M value.
Design Encodings :
  • Both curves are solid black lines; curve "a" is steeper than "b".
  • No markers, error bars, or colour coding.
Distribution & Trends :
  • Curve "a" shows a sharp threshold-like activation of cyclin protease as cdc2 kinase increases.
  • Curve "b" shows a more graded, less switch-like response.

# Analysis :
  • Both panels illustrate the effect of parameter changes (likely the ratio of V3/V4 or K1) on the sharpness of the activation curves.
  • In both cases, curve "a" represents a more switch-like, ultrasensitive response, while curve "b" is more graded.
  • The presence of threshold markers (C* and M*) highlights critical points for activation.
  • The data suggest that system parameters can tune the response from graded to highly ultrasensitive, which is relevant for cell cycle transitions. <!-- figure, from page 0 (l=0.526,t=0.069,r=0.930,b=0.706), with ID d7998862-ab68-4081-bd26-8654a58e7271 -->

exceeds the threshold $M^*$ for activation of $X$. The level of the active cyclin protease therefore begins to rise, after a lag due to the time required for $M$ to increase above $M^*$ and to the time taken by the converter enzymes to change the level of $X$ in the second cycle of the cascade. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.525,t=0.715,r=0.926,b=0.779), with ID 5c20b176-42bf-432e-b365-b4249db38953 -->

Thus, while the abrupt rise in the active cdc2 kinase M
brings about the various biochemical events leading to mitosis,
it also causes a sharp increase in the activity of the cyclin
protease X. Once the latter becomes activated in the mono-
cyclic (or multicyclic) cascade of covalent modification con-
trolled by cdc2 kinase, the rate of cyclin degradation rapidly
exceeds its rate of synthesis, so that the level of cyclin begins
to drop precipitously and C falls below C*. As a result of the
steep dependence of M on C (curve a in Fig. 2A), the cdc2
kinase is rapidly inactivated, so that M drops below M*. The
sharp dependence of X on M (curve a in Fig. 2B) is such that
the cyclin protease rapidly becomes inactivated. These events
thus lead, after a lag, to a sharp drop first in M and soon after
in X; then the constant rate of cyclin synthesis can again <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.522,t=0.780,r=0.922,b=0.957), with ID 8ce2ccb1-6301-4aeb-9687-4207b260fe80 -->

  • The peaks of M and X are closely aligned in time, following the rise of C and preceding its rapid fall.
  • The oscillations are regular and sustained over the 100 min time course.

# Analysis :

The waveform and period of the oscillations in Fig. 3 match
those reported experimentally (2, 6, 8, 22). Moreover, the
model accounts for the observation in extracts of amphibian
embryos (6) that an increase in the rate of cyclin synthesis
shortens the interphase preceding mitosis. The length of that
phase is indeed dictated by the slow rise of C up to its threshold
value C*, in which abrupt activation of the cdc2 kinase begins. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.080,t=0.387,r=0.480,b=0.476), with ID 7923c772-e804-4fc1-ab26-d1bacbbb4bc6 -->

In the phase space ($C, M, X$), regardless of initial conditions, the system reaches a unique, closed trajectory. Sustained oscillations in the cascade model therefore correspond to the evolution towards a limit cycle around a nonequilibrium, unstable steady state (34). The projection of this limit cycle in the cyclin–cdc2 kinase space is shown in Fig. 4. Oscillations of the limit cycle type are particularly stable, as they are characterized by an amplitude and period that are fixed for a given set of parameter values. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.080,t=0.476,r=0.480,b=0.590), with ID fd58a5fe-4d92-4f94-9fea-cb1b73d608fa -->

that the cascade ceases to oscillate when the activation curves
for M and X lack the steepness associated with zero-order
ultrasensitivity. Thus, integration of Eqs. 1 in the conditions of
curves b in Fig. 2 shows that the system reaches a stable steady
state. These results indicate that the time lags associated with
the thresholds in covalent modification are required for in-
ducing oscillations in the cascade controlling mitosis. A fur-
ther role of the thresholds is to provide increased responsive-
ness to small changes in cyclin concentration; such enhanced
sensitivity underlies the abrupt changes that allow the cascade
to function in a seesaw manner. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.511,t=0.061,r=0.913,b=0.203), with ID afbf0a57-d9f2-4874-86c1-4f749f8cbe9e -->

Discussion
The suggestion that the cell cycle is controlled by a continuous biochemical oscillator of the limit cycle type was put forward in a theoretical and experimental study of mitosis in Physarum (35). Because of the lack of biochemical information, however, the chemical nature of the oscillator in that study remained unspecified. The recent convergence of genetic and biochemical approaches has since led to significant breakthroughs in the search for the mechanism that regulates the onset of mitosis. On the basis of these experimental advances, a minimal molecular model for the mitotic oscillator is proposed. The results support the inclusion (34) of the mitotic control system among the chemical and biological processes capable of nonequilibrium self-organization in the form of limit cycle oscillatory behavior. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.512,t=0.209,r=0.913,b=0.404), with ID 71b5c39c-9434-43c3-847d-c7429b9900ba -->

The model relies on the cascade of phosphorylation-
dephosphorylation cycles involving cyclin and cdc2 kinase as
uncovered in the early stages of frog embryogenesis, where
cyclin accumulation suffices to drive the cell cycle. The
progressive rise of cyclin beyond a threshold triggers the
activation of cdc2 kinase; the latter in turn elicits cyclin
degradation, which switches off the activation of cdc2 kinase
and thereby resets the system for a new mitotic cycle. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.513,t=0.405,r=0.912,b=0.506), with ID 3303bd40-b1b0-4b08-82c9-37ce7bc4ea35 -->

A key result of the present analysis is the demonstration
that sustained oscillations in cdc2 kinase and cyclin of
appropriate period and waveform can arise from thresholds
and time delays built into the cascade of post-translational
modification controlling the activation of cdc2 kinase and
cyclin proteolysis. The time delays are not introduced, as is
often the case, in an ad hoc manner; rather, they are a natural
consequence of the thresholds that characterize the depen-
dence of cdc2 kinase activation on cyclin, and of cyclin
proteolysis on cdc2 kinase. These thresholds originate in the
model from the kinetic characteristics of covalent modifica-
tion: any couple of converter enzymes such as a kinase and
its associated phosphatase possesses the potential to function
as a biochemical switch; a sharp transition will indeed occur
in the steady-state level of phosphorylated protein whenever
the converter enzymes are saturated by their substrate (30). <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.513,t=0.507,r=0.913,b=0.709), with ID 486c7ec2-5662-48b7-9235-bff38279c826 -->

The results support the view, derived from experiments on
extracts of amphibian embryos (2, 3, 6-8), that the cell cycle
is driven by continuous biochemical oscillations and that the
triggering by cdc2 kinase of cyclin degradation creates a
negative feedback loop on which a minimum cell-cycle oscil-
lator could be based (8). In particular, the model fully corrobo-
rates the conjecture put forward by Félix et al. (8) for whom
"the system cannot reach equilibrium: it keeps oscillating,
because threshold levels of both cyclin protein and cdc2 kinase
activities trigger post-translational reactions with built-in time
delays, and the destruction of cyclin causes the loss of cdc2
kinase activity." The present model represents a simple
mathematical implementation of such a minimum cell-cycle
oscillator. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.516,t=0.709,r=0.914,b=0.883), with ID 570fe54f-92e5-4b0a-a751-053ebe247d68 -->

Although the model provides an appealingly straightforward explanation for the origin of thresholds in the post-translational modification cycles controlling cdc2 kinase and cyclin proteolysis, the putative role of zero-order ultrasensitivity in the origin of these thresholds remains to be <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.517,t=0.884,r=0.915,b=0.947), with ID 3ef0694e-d2c4-4253-8a3e-96df5a47477b -->

established. Other mechanisms based, for example, on the
action of an inhibitory phosphatase that reverts a cdc2
phosphorylation apparently required for activity have been
invoked (14, 36) to explain the requirement for a critical level
of cyclin as well as the lag in the activation of cdc2 kinase;
alternatively, the target of that phosphatase might be cdc2
activase (26). Whatever the origin of the thresholds, the
model shows how time delays arise from them to give rise to
sustained oscillations around an unstable steady state. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.103,t=0.050,r=0.505,b=0.165), with ID 5419fdfc-1aa3-4436-bca5-39320c848d76 -->

Another result of the analysis is the demonstration that
positive feedback is not required for oscillations. This is in
contrast with previous models (37, 38), which were based on
the autocatalytic activation of cdc2 kinase but did not take into
account the kinetic characteristics of covalent modification;
oscillations do not occur in these models in the absence of
autocatalysis. Self-amplification in activation of maturation-
promoting factor has been described experimentally (14); the
phenomenon could originate from the activation of the cdc2
activase (i.e., phosphatase) through phosphorylation by cdc2
kinase (16, 25-27), or from some autophosphorylation (15).
Any form of autocatalysis would favor the occurrence of
periodic behavior, as is well known in other biochemical (39)
and chemical systems (34). The model nevertheless supports
the conjecture (8) that the oscillatory mechanism primarily
rests on both the delayed negative feedback provided by
cdc2-induced cyclin degradation and the combined occurrence
of thresholds and time lags in the cascade of post-translational
modification. In this respect, the mechanism proposed for the
periodic activation of cdc2 kinase differs from other examples
of oscillatory behavior in biochemistry such as glycolytic
oscillations in yeast (40), the periodic generation of cAMP
pulses in Dictyostelium (41), or intracellular calcium oscilla-
tions (42, 43), which all originate from positive feedback
amplified by the cooperativity of allosteric interactions. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.100,t=0.166,r=0.503,b=0.482), with ID 5b60aa26-8a51-424c-a85c-83c9c35719be -->

The model presented for the mitotic oscillator is conspicuous by its robustness in producing oscillations. The latter, indeed, occur over a wide range of parameter values once sharp thresholds occur in the activation of cdc2 kinase and cyclin protease. When the thresholds are less sharp, as in the conditions of Fig. 4, the domain of periodic behavior is reduced and the oscillations are smoother than those of Fig. 3. While cdc2 kinase and cyclin protease are both controlled by a single cycle of phosphorylation–dephosphorylation in this minimal model, it is likely that additional cycles of covalent modification are involved (16, 25, 26). Such a lengthening of the cascade, besides introducing further delays, could produce sharper thresholds in covalent modification, since the sensitivity gained in one cycle can be amplified in subsequent cycles (30, 31). In such a way, the multiplicity of covalent modification cycles could increase the robustness of the mitotic clock. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.096,t=0.482,r=0.497,b=0.697), with ID ac7a7a1d-927e-410b-a6d8-3cb6240198f2 -->

That the reactions controlling the onset of mitosis are
organized as a network of covalent modification cycles also
multiplies the potential sites of regulation and thereby sug-
gests different ways of arresting the cell cycle, besides a
major alteration of the balance between cyclin synthesis and
degradation. Thus the oscillations can be suppressed if the
ratios of effective maximum rates of the converter enzymes,
V₁/V₂ or V₂/V₄, are held below their threshold values. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.092,t=0.697,r=0.494,b=0.796), with ID 79c1c0e1-2d77-435b-b84a-a68c8e5e54c7 -->

The question arises as to the applicability of the model to
cell cycles subject to more complex regulation than in early
embryogenesis. In yeast, an additional control occurs at the
“start” point before DNA replication (1, 9); two different
states of cdc2 kinase are involved in the checkpoints before
“start” and mitosis (44), corresponding to two different
forms of covalently modified cdc2 per cycle (15, 44). Each of
these two forms could be involved in an oscillator similar to
the one described here, with its own cyclin (45), cyclin
protease, and set of converter enzymes; the alternation <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.090,t=0.796,r=0.490,b=0.924), with ID 79a9ee56-c766-42df-a5de-8104ea5508be -->

between the two forms of active cdc2 kinase would result
from the coupling of the two oscillators (2). The minimum
oscillating cascade of Fig. 1 could thus provide a "building
clock" for the more complex mechanisms underlying the cell
cycle in yeast or somatic cells. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.537,t=0.049,r=0.939,b=0.117), with ID 4df166dc-b97c-4bc6-92b1-d186c95d90c6 -->
