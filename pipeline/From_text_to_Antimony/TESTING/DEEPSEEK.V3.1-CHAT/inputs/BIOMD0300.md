Abstract

Background: The activity of the heterodimeric transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) is regulated by the post-translational, oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of its α-subunit by members of the prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD or EGLN)-family and by factor inhibiting HIF (FIH). PHD-dependent hydroxylation targets HIFα for rapid proteasomal degradation; FIH-catalysed asparaginyl-hydroxylation of the C-terminal transactivation domain (CAD) of HIFα suppresses the CAD-dependent subset of the extensive transcriptional responses induced by HIF. FIH can also hydroxylate ankyrin-repeat domain (ARD) proteins, a large group of proteins which are functionally unrelated but share common structural features. Competition by ARD proteins for FIH is hypothesised to affect FIH activity towards HIFα; however the extent of this competition and its effect on the HIF-dependent hypoxic response are unknown. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.099,t=0.340,r=0.900,b=0.501), with ID 69c9ffed-9eec-4640-9092-eadcf471418e -->

**Results:** To analyse if and in which way the FIH/ARD protein interaction affects HIF-activity, we created a rate equation model. Our model predicts that an oxygen-regulated sequestration of FIH by ARD proteins significantly shapes the input/output characteristics of the HIF system. The FIH/ARD protein interaction is predicted to create an oxygen threshold for HIFα CAD-hydroxylation and to significantly sharpen the signal/response curves, which not only focuses HIFα CAD-hydroxylation into a defined range of oxygen tensions, but also makes the response ultrasensitive to varying oxygen tensions. Our model further suggests that the hydroxylation status of the ARD protein pool can encode the strength and the duration of a hypoxic episode, which may allow cells to memorise these features for a certain time period after reoxygenation. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.100,t=0.503,r=0.900,b=0.626), with ID 77a29784-013d-4c94-9ed8-61d61860a466 -->

**Conclusions:** The FIH/ARD protein interaction has the potential to contribute to oxygen-range finding, can sensitise the response to changes in oxygen levels, and can provide a memory of the strength and the duration of a hypoxic episode. These emergent properties are predicted to significantly shape the characteristics of HIF activity in animal cells. We argue that the FIH/ARD interaction should be taken into account in studies of the effect of pharmacological inhibition of the HIF-hydroxylases and propose that the interaction of a signalling sensor with a large group of proteins might be a general mechanism for the regulation of signalling pathways. <!-- text, from page 0 (l=0.099,t=0.627,r=0.901,b=0.721), with ID 1a3fd5d0-c17d-45d2-96f3-53351806a831 -->

Background
In animals, the response to hypoxia is mediated by an α, β-heterodimeric transcription factor, the hypoxia inducible factor or HIF. In humans, there are three different HIFα isoforms, with HIF1α and HIF2α being better characterised than HIF3α. The HIFβ subunit is identical with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). Both the level and transcriptional activity of HIF are regulated by post-translational hydroxylation of the HIFα, but not HIFβ, subunit. In the presence of sufficient oxygen, HIF1α and HIF2α undergo hydroxylation of two proline-residues in their oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD), reactions catalysed by three Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD1-3 or EGLN1-3) enzymes [1]. In healthy mammalian cells, PHD2 is the most important regulator of the hypoxic response as shown by cellular [2] and animal studies [3]. HIF1α and HIF2α also undergo asparaginyl hydroxylation [4] of the C-terminal (CAD) of the two transactivation domains found in HIFα (CAD-hydroxylation). This reaction is catalysed by factor inhibiting HIF (FIH), which is also an Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase [5,6]. HIFα prolyl hydroxylation by PHDs very substantially increases its binding to the von Hippel Lindau protein (pVHL), which acts as a targeting component for an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and thus mediates rapid degradation of HIFα by the proteasome. When PHD catalysis is limited by oxygen availability, i.e. in hypoxia, HIFα degradation is slowed, its level rises, it dimerises with HIFβ and upregulates HIF-target gene transcription. In contrast to the PHD-dependent ODD-hydroxylation, FIH-dependent CAD-hydroxylation does not affect the stability of HIFα, but more directly decreases the transcriptional activity of HIF by blocking the recruitment of the transcriptional co-regulator p300/CBP to the CAD [4,6], thus disrupting CAD-dependent target gene expression. In contrast, target genes that depend on the N-terminal transactivation domain (NAD) of HIFα are not affected by FIH activity [7]. For reviews see [8-10]. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.089,t=0.110,r=0.495,b=0.712), with ID 7276b49b-49ea-42ff-96ff-18a7195f74fd -->

More recently, it has become clear that HIFα is not
the only FIH substrate, but that FIH also catalyses the
hydroxylation of a wide range of other proteins [11-16].
With the notable exception of HIFα itself, all FIH sub-
strates identified to date contain an ankyrin-repeat
domain (ARD), an evolutionarily ancient structural
domain found in all kingdoms of life [17]. ARDs seem
to predominantly mediate protein-protein interactions
[18], and occur in proteins as diverse as signal transduc-
ers, ion channels, cell cycle regulators, transcriptional
regulators and chromatin-associated proteins. ARD pro-
teins contain varying numbers of ankyrin repeats (ARs).
ARs are one of the most commonly occurring protein <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.089,t=0.715,r=0.494,b=0.911), with ID f619dade-7f28-4123-826b-ea72646dc2e9 -->

repeats in animals [17]. The stereotypical AR consists of
33 amino acid residues and has an L-shaped fold, which
is formed by two short α-helices, arranged in an anti-
parallel fashion, and, perpendicular to the helices, a pro-
truding loop region followed by a β-hairpin. The aspara-
gine residue targeted by FIH in some ARs is located in
the loop region. ARs stack together to form an ARD,
which, in humans, can contain up to 28 ARs. Several
studies suggest that AR-hydroxylation by FIH is wide-
spread [11-16], however its biological significance is
unclear. Studies with consensus ARDs suggest that
hydroxylation may cause an increase in the thermody-
namic stability of the ARD fold [19,20], and some evi-
dence points to a potential role for ARD hydroxylation
in signalling crosstalk in the cases of Notch [13,16] and
NFκB/IκBα [11]. Because the inhibition of HIFα CAD-
dependent transcription remains the only well-defined
functional outcome of the catalytic activity of FIH, ARD
proteins have been speculated to fine-tune FIH activity
towards HIFα by binding and sequestering FIH [12,21].
The discovery that FIH interacts with multiple ARD
proteins raises major questions as to the role of FIH as
an oxygen sensor. To our knowledge, the proposal that
the interaction of multiple proteins with a sensor has a
regulatory role, is unprecedented. It is unclear what
effect the competitive inhibition of FIH by ARD proteins
would have on signal processing and on the input/out-
put relation of the network. Because the proposed regu-
latory effect of ARD proteins on FIH involves multiple
interactions it is difficult to study via classical
approaches. We therefore decided to study a mass and a rate
equation model of HIFα CAD-hydroxylation. <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.507,t=0.110,r=0.910,b=0.592), with ID f5004a87-9b1d-4fed-88c7-74c168371a9a -->

Our model predicts that the presence of ARD proteins
and their hydroxylation by FIH can indeed fine-tune
HIFα CAD-hydroxylation, provided that the affinity of
FIH for ARD proteins is significantly weakened by their
hydroxylation. The simulations highlight unexpected
functional consequences of the FIH/ARD protein inter-
action for the hypoxic response: By creating an oxygen
threshold, HIFα CAD-hydroxylation is predicted to be
focused into a defined range of oxygen tensions (range
finding mechanism), the signal/response curves of HIFα
CAD-hydroxylation is predicted to become significantly
sharpened (ultrasensitivity), and, upon reoxygenation,
FIH-release is predicted to occur with a time-delay, the
length of which depends on the duration and the
strength of the preceding hypoxic period (memory
effect). <!-- text, from page 1 (l=0.508,t=0.593,r=0.911,b=0.834), with ID 5a36fa20-fad9-4dbf-8a41-4e99a567ca66 -->

*Modelling and modelling assumptions*  
For the HIF-hydroxylases to act as oxygen sensors in the  
proposed manner, their activity in cells must be limited  
by oxygen availability. Moreover, to ensure that HIFα-  
levels and the amount of HIF bound to DNA reflect the <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.091,t=0.602,r=0.493,b=0.679), with ID 5abe7e85-e789-4f6d-9a44-a9741103f72e -->

intracellular oxygen tension at all times, ODD-hydroxy-
lation must be rate-limiting rather than degradation of
ODD-hydroxylated HIFα, complex formation with HIFβ
or DNA-binding of HIF. These requirements allow us to
make the following simplifying assumptions: Firstly,
HIFβ and the hydroxylase co-substrates, 2-oxoglutarate
and Fe(II), are not limiting, and secondly, the degrada-
tion of ODD-hydroxylated HIFα as well as binding of
HIF to hypoxia response elements are fast compared to
the ODD-hydroxylation reaction. Although we appreci-
ate that under some conditions these assumptions may
not be valid, for instance in some tumour cells [25,26], a
body of evidence suggests that these assumptions are
reasonable for normal cells. All simulations were done
using the open source software XPP-AUT [27]. Steady
state values were calculated by running time course
simulations at different oxygen-tensions until a steady
state was reached. <!-- text, from page 2 (l=0.509,t=0.109,r=0.910,b=0.380), with ID 844bd1ea-2462-4227-bb9c-9b03f96f7c3e -->

*The Full Model*
For the hydroxylation rate functions in the Full Model, we take into account that free HIFα concentration decreases by binding to the enzymes ("full model kinetics", see also Additional File 2). Unlike classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, this approach is also valid if there is no substrate excess, a situation that is frequently encountered in protein-protein interaction networks [28]. Because of the expected excess of ARD proteins over FIH, we use the Michaelis-Menten approximation for FIH-catalysed AR-hydroxylation. The Full Model is defined by three ordinary differential equations, which are given in dimensionless form. The CAD-hydroxylated forms of HIFα and the ARD proteins are defined by mass conservation. "Hat" (^) indicates non-dimensional quantities expressed relative to the maximal amount of HIFα present in the absence of oxygen, and "prime00000000000" (') indicates non-dimensional quantities expressed relative to the basal degradation rate constant for HIFα. Oxygen is given relative to the K_M of PHD for oxygen, which is indicated by "tilde" (~).

Parameter values  
Experimental information restricts the biologically relevant range of parameter values and allows estimates. The K\textsubscript{M} of PHDs for oxygen has been reported to be in the range of approximately 220-250 μM [29] and references therein. This is slightly higher than the maximal solubility of oxygen in water, which sets a theoretical upper limit for intracellular oxygen concentrations. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.092,t=0.801,r=0.492,b=0.923), with ID f993596b-dc18-4c3c-89cb-3e35b65020c7 -->

Thus, the biologically relevant range of oxygen-tensions
must be below this value. The K\(_M\) of FIH for oxygen
has been reported to be lower than the K\(_M\) of the PHDs
[30], which we take into account. We normalise to the
maximal amount of HIFα, \(H_{tot}^{max} = 1\), which is reached
at steady state in the absence of oxygen-dependent
degradation. Three parameters define HIFα ODD-
hydroxylation, the dissociation constant of the PHD/
HIFα interaction, \(\hat{K}_D^P\); the maximal reaction rate, \(v_{max}^P\);
and the PHD concentration, \(P_{tot}\). We used the reported
value of 1 μM for the PHD/HIFα binding affinity [29], i.
e. \(\hat{K}_D^P = 1\). We then chose \(v_{max}^P\) such that a good agree- <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.508,t=0.109,r=0.910,b=0.315), with ID e8e30294-6651-46a8-a334-75aef9e683c4 -->

ment with measured signal/response curves was
obtained [31]. PHD expression levels relative to HIFα
are not known, and the concentration of PHD was set
to 0.2, an assumption which does not affect any of our
conclusions. In our simulations, the overall rate of FIH
hydroxylation must be higher than the overall rate of
PHD hydroxylation for significant HIFα CAD-hydroxy-
lation to occur. The means by which high FIH activity is
achieved are irrelevant for our conclusions (data not
shown), whether by higher expression levels, higher affi-
nity for HIFα or a faster turnover rate. We thus intro-
duce an arbitrary five-fold excess of FIH over PHD,
which allows us to clearly illustrate the inhibitory effect
of the ARD proteins on FIH activity. The binding affi-
nity of FIH for HIFα and the turnover rate are set to
match the values for PHD. _In vivo_, FIH activity might
be lower than assumed in the model, however all our
conclusions are qualitative and thus entirely indepen-
dent of these assumptions. Table 2 summarises the
dimensionless parameter values that were used for cal-
culating the graphs shown, unless indicated otherwise in
the figure legends. The model can be found in the Bio-

Results
Potential ankyrin-type FIH targets in the human proteome
To investigate the potential extent of ARD protein interaction with FIH, we initially carried out bioinformatic analyses. Searching the SMART [22], PFAM [23] and Uniprot [24] databases for human AR-sequences, we found 1505 annotated ankyrin repeats (ARs) mapping to 252 distinct human ARD proteins. All 1505 ARs were assembled into a database (Additional File 1) and analysed for the presence of a potential FIH hydroxylation site. Diagnostic features were then extracted from experimentally verified target sequences to aid the prediction of AR-type FIH substrates and give an estimate of their overall abundance. <!-- text, from page 4 (l=0.507,t=0.696,r=0.911,b=0.924), with ID 14c69fec-0c53-4ca9-9ac5-69e207be7f11 -->

The minimal requirement for a specific AR to be an FIH substrate is the presence of a hydroxylatable residue in the loop region downstream of the second α-helix, located at position 29 of the prototypical 33 residue ankyrin repeat consensus sequence (Figure 1A). A total of 922 human AR (61%) were found to contain one or more asparagines within the loop region, i.e. between positions 25 and 33 of the repeat. This subgroup was termed Asn-repeats, and all are potential FIH targets. The remaining 584 human AR (39%) lack an asparagine between consensus positions 25 and 33 (non-Asn-repeats). Experimental studies have identified a number of ARs that are hydroxylated by FIH either in vivo or at least in vitro (Additional File 3, Table S1), or interact with FIH (Additional File 3, Table S2). Comparison of the sequences of ARs that are hydroxylated in vivo with the hydroxylation motif in the C-terminal transactivation domain of HIFα reveals several conserved features that might allow prediction of whether or not a given AR is an FIH target (Figure 1B). All but one FIH target- <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.090,t=0.109,r=0.493,b=0.413), with ID 800c1860-15bc-4576-84a2-97a14a49669a -->

repeats verified as such in vivo have a leucine residue at
position -8 relative to the hydroxylated asparagine (L-8N
group), which is also present in HIFα and in the AR
consensus sequence. Other features found in HIFα that
are also commonly present in verified ankyrin-type in
vivo substrates of FIH are a hydrophobic residue (valine
or isoleucine) at position -1 relative to Asn-29, a polar
residue such as glutamic acid or aspartic acid/asparagine
in position -2, and an alanine or cysteine at position -3
relative to the Asn-29, which may be important in bind-
ing to the active site of FIH [13]. To investigate a possi-
ble correlation between the presence of an L-8N motif
and the conservation of the residues at positions -3, -2
and -1 relative to Asn-29, we compared alignments of
L-8N repeats (Figure 1C) and ARs lacking an L-8N motif
(Figure 1D). Sequence logos [32] of alignments of all
ARs (Figure 1E) as well as of experimentally verified
hydroxylation targets (Figure 1F) are shown for compar-
ison. We found that the features conserved between
HIFα and verified ankyrin-type hydroxylation targets are <!-- text, from page 5 (l=0.507,t=0.110,r=0.910,b=0.414), with ID acc78b23-15b3-48ad-94f3-9eacdfb9f7e6 -->

Summary : This figure presents a bioinformatic analysis of human ankyrin repeats, focusing on the consensus sequence, experimentally verified FIH (factor inhibiting HIF) substrates, and sequence conservation at the hydroxylation site. It includes a schematic of the consensus sequence, alignments of in vivo FIH substrates, and sequence logos comparing conservation across different ankyrin repeat subgroups.

  • Secondary structure elements are indicated: α-helix 1 (residues 3–11), α-helix 2 (residues 15–23), and a loop (residues 24–33).
  • Position 29 (Asn) in the loop is the hydroxylation site.

# B. In vivo FIH Substrates :

  • Sequences are shown with conserved residues highlighted.
  • Includes the ankyrin repeat consensus and hydroxylation regions of HIF1/2α for comparison.

# C–F. Sequence Logos of Ankyrin Repeat Subgroups :
  • Sequence logos display conservation at residues 21–32 (LLEHGADVNAQD) for different subgroups:
    - C. L-8N repeats (32–34 residues, n=443): High conservation, especially at L, G, A, D, V, N, D.
    - D. Non L-8N repeats (32–34 residues, n=917): Lower conservation at the hydroxylation site.
    - E. All repeats (32–34 residues, n=1360): Intermediate conservation.
    - F. In vivo FIH substrates (n=17): High conservation at L, G, A, D, V, N, D, with some variation at other positions.

# Design Encodings :
  • Sequence logos use letter height to indicate % conservation at each position.
  • Alignments use shading to highlight conserved residues.
  • Schematic uses arrows and cylinders to denote secondary structure.

# Analysis :
  • The ankyrin repeat consensus sequence is highly conserved, especially at the hydroxylation site (Asn-29).
  • L-8N repeats show much higher conservation at the hydroxylation site compared to non L-8N repeats.
  • Experimentally verified FIH substrates closely match the consensus at key positions, supporting their selection for hydroxylation.
  • The sequence logos visually demonstrate the degree of conservation across different ankyrin repeat subgroups, with the highest conservation in L-8N repeats and in vivo FIH substrates. <!-- figure, from page 5 (l=0.094,t=0.431,r=0.908,b=0.921), with ID dd56fc52-5164-4204-b823-2faebcb9f8e2 -->

enriched in the subgroup of L-⁸N-repeats compared to
ARs without an L-⁸N motif (compare Figures 1C and
1D). Thus, the presence of an L-⁸N motif seems to cor-
relate with the presence of several additional features
that are also present in HIFα, and thus appears to
define a subgroup of human ARs, which likely contains
most FIH target repeats. It is tempting to speculate that
the higher degree of conservation found in positions -1,
-2 and -3 relative to Asn-29 has been maintained in the
L-⁸N group because these residues are important for
FIH-dependent hydroxylation. However, other explana-
tions such as structural requirements are also possible. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.091,t=0.110,r=0.493,b=0.290), with ID f17ec296-cddb-4456-b39d-894c15d6a1f3 -->

Overall, we analysed and classified 1505 individual
human ankyrin repeats (Table 3). We find that 472
human ankyrin repeats (31%) in 182 distinct ARD pro-
teins contain an L^8-N motif. Applying more stringent
criteria, the most likely ankyrin-type hydroxylation tar-
gets of FIH have the consensus sequence 21-L(X)4(AC)
(DEN)(ILV)N-29, which is found in 166 ARs mapping to
105 ARD proteins. Thus, 166 likely is a lower limit for
the number of ankyrin-type FIH asparaginyl-hydroxyla-
tion targets. The large number of AR-type FIH targets
supports the idea that FIH-hydroxylatable ARD proteins
can compete with HIFα for FIH binding. How this
would contribute to the suggested “fine-tuning” of HIF-
regulation is however not obvious, because a strong,
constitutive sequestration of FIH by ARD proteins
would merely attenuate FIH activity towards HIFα at all
oxygen concentrations. Also, the affinity of FIH for
ARDs can be higher than its affinity for HIFα [33,34],
and it is difficult to envisage how HIFα CAD-hydroxyla-
tion can occur at all in the presence of such a large
pool of efficient competitors. However, hydroxylation of
ARs has been shown to significantly decrease their affi-
nity for FIH [13], suggesting that FIH, by hydroxylating
ARs in an oxygen dependent manner, is able to trigger
its own release from ARD protein sequestration
[12,14,21]. To test this proposal and to investigate its
implications for the hypoxic response, we devised and
analysed a rate equation model describing these
processes. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.090,t=0.290,r=0.494,b=0.729), with ID b41ee3eb-8811-458a-9970-133291043125 -->

Kinetic modelling  
We set out to model the scenario that, under normoxic conditions, when the catalytic activity of FIH is high, more ARs will be hydroxylated and thus less able to bind and sequester FIH, a larger proportion of which will be free to target HIFα. When oxygen becomes limiting under hypoxic conditions, FIH catalytic activity will decrease, the fraction of unhydroxylated ARs will rise, and FIH will be sequestered from HIFα more efficiently. In a modular approach, we first analysed two skeleton models, each aimed at capturing the essence of a distinct aspect of the system (Figure 2). Skeleton Model 1 (SKM1) describes the reactions affecting HIFα (basal HIFα turnover, ODD-hydroxylation-induced degradation of HIFα, HIFα CAD-hydroxylation), but ignores the presence of ARD proteins. Skeleton Model 2 (SKM2) describes the reactions affecting ARD proteins (basal ARD protein turnover, FIH binding to ARD proteins, their hydroxylation, and hydroxylation-dependent FIH-release). Because of their parsimony, the skeleton models provide significant insight into the logic of these processes. Both skeleton models were then fused into a Full Model, which we used to study if and how oxygen-regulated competitive inhibition by ARD proteins can shape the hypoxic response. The XPP-AUT modelling file is listed as Additional file 4. <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.507,t=0.108,r=0.911,b=0.503), with ID 5f7f334e-fefa-49d1-96af-d40ad96007b0 -->

Skeleton Model 1 - HIFα CAD-hydroxylation in the absence of the FIH/AR-interaction  
By targeting HIFα for degradation in an oxygen-dependent manner, PHD activity restricts the amount of HIFα that is available for FIH-dependent HIFα CAD-hydroxylation (Figure 3A, bold black curve). Oxygen-dependent FIH activity then determines the fraction of total HIFα that is CAD-hydroxylated. Increasing FIH activity shifts the curve of non-CAD-hydroxylated HIFα to the left towards lower oxygen-tensions (Figure 3A). Thus, the higher FIH activity, the more severe the hypoxia that is required to induce transcription of CAD-dependent target genes. The model predicts two regions of distinct gene expression, which are defined by the oxygen-tension (Figure 3B). A decrease in oxygen-levels first leads into a regime where hypoxia response elements (HRE) start to become occupied by accumulating HIF, however a lot of the occupying HIF contains CAD-hydroxylated HIFα. In this region, NAD-dependent genes are expressed (Figure 3B, grey shading), but CAD-dependent genes remain repressed. The model predicts that a further decrease in oxygen-levels will cause non-CAD-hydroxylated HIFα to increase sufficiently to allow expression of CAD-dependent genes. In this regime, both NAD- and CAD-dependent genes are expressed (Figure 3B, green shading). The predictions in the model are <!-- text, from page 6 (l=0.507,t=0.515,r=0.911,b=0.912), with ID ee5966f7-1199-44a8-a20b-95984560257a -->

  • FIH is a shared enzyme in both models, as indicated by the dotted arrow.
  • The diagram emphasizes the role of oxygen and FIH in the hydroxylation steps, and the explicit labeling of rate constants/functions allows for direct mapping to mathematical models.
  • The overall workflow is linear for SKM1 and more branched for SKM2 due to the reversible complex formation. <!-- figure, from page 7 (l=0.091,t=0.109,r=0.909,b=0.473), with ID c9adce83-6897-400e-befd-5cdc77a56a19 -->

Distribution & Trends :  
  • All curves are sigmoidal, decreasing from ~1 to ~0 as Ō₂ increases.

# Panel B: Probability of an HRE to be bound by different forms of HIF

Title & Axes :  
  • Title: "Probability of an HRE to be bound by different forms of HIF"  
  • X-axis: "Ō₂" (oxygen tension, log scale), tick labels: 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1  
  • Y-axis: "probability", range: 0 to 1

    – Light red: "CADOH genes on"

# Analysis :
  • Increasing FIH activity shifts the response of non-CAD-hydroxylated HIFα to lower oxygen tensions, as seen by the leftward shift of colored lines in Panel A.
  • The probability of HRE binding by different HIFα forms is oxygen-dependent, with distinct activation windows for different gene sets.
  • The model predicts that gene activation thresholds and the form of HIFα present are tightly regulated by oxygen tension and FIH activity.
  • The red dotted line in Panel B suggests that CAD-hydroxylated HIFα is most prevalent at intermediate oxygen levels, while unhydroxylated forms dominate at low oxygen. <!-- figure, from page 7 (l=0.092,t=0.502,r=0.906,b=0.786), with ID c29f91d4-8792-46c1-ab6f-3628a198cda7 -->

were $\hat{K}_D^B = \hat{K}_D^F = 1, k_{cat}^D \hat{P}_{tot} = k_{cat}^{FH} \hat{F}_{tot} = 100$. In this example, FIH activity was increased by lowering its $K_M$ for oxygen relative to PHD's $K_M$ for oxygen, however any change in parameters that leads to higher FIH activity gives similar results (data not shown). The green curve ($\alpha = 1$) represents the case where all kinetic parameters for FIH and PHD are identical. B. Activation status of hypoxia-response elements (HREs). Probabilities for an HRE to be bound by either HIF$\alpha$ that is not CAD-hydroxylated (green solid curve), by CAD-hydroxylated HIF$\alpha$ (red dotted curve) or either form of HIF$\alpha$ (bold black curve) under the assumption that all forms of HIF bind with identical affinity to the HRE ($\hat{K}_D^{HRE} = 0.3$). We propose the existence of a novel set of HIF target genes, which are transcriptionally activated by CAD-hydroxylated HIF$\alpha$ (CADOH-dependent genes). The regimes of differential gene expression are indicated by shading (an arbitrary gene activation threshold was introduced at 20% HRE occupancy).

severe hypoxia is required to activate CAD-dependent
genes than to activate NAD-dependent genes is consis-
tent with previous experimental results [7]. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.091,t=0.111,r=0.492,b=0.154), with ID 08d2f455-fa47-44d5-baf8-fd1146aac155 -->

Experimentally, CAD-dependent genes, but not NAD-
dependent genes, are induced by FIH knockdown and
repressed by FIH overexpression [7]. Interestingly, a
third group of HIF target genes have been described,
which show the opposite behaviour to CAD-dependent
genes. This group, one member of which is BNIP3
(BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kD interacting protein 3), is
repressed by FIH knockdown and de-repressed by FIH
overexpression [7,35]. To explain this unexpected behav-
iour, a CAD-dependently expressed repressor was pos-
tulated, which would be present only at very low oxygen
concentrations [7]. Our model suggests a more parsim-
onious explanation, which can explain the unusual behav-
iour of some HIF target genes. We propose that BNIP3
belongs to a third, novel class of target genes, which are
specifically activated by the CAD-hydroxylated HIFα
(CADOH-dependent, Figure 3B, red shading), and thus
expressed in a p300/CBP-independent manner. This
proposal assigns a potential direct function to CAD-
hydroxylated HIFα, and we studied the behaviour of this
species in more detail. Because FIH activity is a monoto-
nically increasing function of oxygen, the naive expecta-
tion is that the amount of CAD-hydroxylated HIFα
should also increase monotonically (at least until a
saturation point) with increasing oxygen-levels. The
model predicts however that this is not the case and
that the level of CAD-hydroxylated HIFα will peak at
intermediate oxygen tensions. The location and magni-
tude of the peak of CAD-hydroxylated HIFα are para-
meter dependent, but its existence is a generic system
property. The postulated group of CADOH-dependent
genes is thus predicted to be expressed at intermediate
hypoxia only (Figure 3B), and to show the bell-shaped
signal/response curve observed experimentally [7]. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.090,t=0.155,r=0.494,b=0.669), with ID 3715fb37-f762-4f6a-a7be-1b09ea274771 -->

Skeleton Model 2 - FIH sequestration by ARD proteins
and oxygen-dependent FIH-release
By ignoring the presence of HIFα, SKM2 reduces the
system to the sequestration of FIH by ARD proteins,
their hydroxylation, and the subsequent oxygen-depen-
dent FIH-release and allows us to define the require-
ments for an “efficient”, FIH-release, which we define as
a clear differential between the levels of free FIH at
high and low oxygen concentrations. Two non-dimen-
sional parameters determine the system behaviour (Fig-
ure 4): The sequestration capacity of the ARD protein
pool (κ), which depends on the total concentration of
ARs and their affinity for FIH; and the hydroxylation
efficiency (β), which is the $v_{max}$ of the hydroxylation
rate of ARD proteins relative to their degradation rate, <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.089,t=0.681,r=0.494,b=0.910), with ID bb677d65-5043-4e38-b57a-9fb8374343ae -->

and thus relates the rate of ΔR-hydroxylation to the
rate of ARD protein turnover. The signal/response
curves (Figures 4A, B) indicate that an efficient FIH-
release requires both the sequestration capacity κ and
the hydroxylation efficiency β to be large. At low oxy-
gen-tensions, the steady state is largely determined by
κ, and the larger κ, the lower the level of free FIH (Fig-
ure 4A). At high oxygen-tensions, the steady state is
determined chiefly by β. A large β value causes a large
fraction of ARs to be in the hydroxylated state and thus
incapable of retaining FIH, particularly at high oxygen-
levels (Figure 4B). The conditions that allow an efficient
and sharp oxygen-dependent release of FIH from ARD
protein-dependent sequestration are identical to those
that favour near-complete hydroxylation of FIH-target
repeats. Thus, SKM2 predicts that near-complete hydro-
xylation of the FIH-accessible fraction of hydroxylatable
target repeats is required for efficient, oxygen-dependent
FIH-release. <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.507,t=0.109,r=0.910,b=0.396), with ID 76af7c3b-caf8-4c1d-8522-4f209d6e55f4 -->

In addition to this steady state analysis, we also simu-
lated the temporal response of the system to step
changes in oxygen concentrations, i.e. to sudden hypoxia
and to sudden reoxygenation after a hypoxic episode.
SKM2 predicts that the time-resolved response to
hypoxia is rather insensitive to variations of κ and β,
with the family of curves showing a hyperbolic decrease
in free FIH with time, either reaching distinct steady
state values at low oxygen when κ is varied (Additional
File 3, Figure S1A), or starting out from distinct steady
state values at high oxygen if β is varied (Additional
File 3, Figure S1B). More interestingly however, the temporal
response to an increase of oxygen after hypoxia (reoxy-
genation) is affected significantly by both, κ and β.
Although variations in κ affect half-response times for
FIH-release only moderately (Figure 4C), varying κ does
significantly mould the shape of the time-response
curves, which change from a gradual FIH-release if κ is
small, to a delayed, switch-like FIH-release if κ is large
(Figure 4C). In contrast to varying κ, varying β substan-
tially affects half response times - the larger β, the faster
the FIH release in response to reoxygenation (Figure
4D). Thus, SKM2 predicts that oxygen-dependent FIH-
release from ARD proteins upon sudden reoxygenation
of hypoxic cells can occur in a switch-like manner, with
a time delay relative to the reoxygenation event. The
reason for this time delay is that, shortly after reoxy-
genation, the concentration of unhydroxylated, FIH-
accessible ARs is still high enough to allow rebinding of
any released FIH. SKM2 thus predicts that a permanent
release of FIH is only achieved once the FIH-accessible
ARs are hydroxylated to a significant extent, and the
concentration of unhydroxylated ARs starts to become
limiting for FIH sequestration, which, due to the excess <!-- text, from page 8 (l=0.507,t=0.397,r=0.911,b=0.909), with ID f18d365d-c3ee-4ed2-b149-60b030037e70 -->

Summary : This figure presents simulation results from Skeleton Model 2, showing how FIH-release is determined by the FIH sequestration capacity of the ARD protein pool (κ) and the efficiency of AR-hydroxylation (β). Four panels (A–D) display steady-state and time-resolved responses of unhydroxylated ARs and free FIH to changes in oxygen concentration and parameter values.

# Panel Overview :
  • Four panels: A (top left), B (top right), C (bottom left), D (bottom right).
  • Each panel contains two series: "unhydrox. ARs" (grey curves) and "free FIH" (blue curves).
  • Panels A and B: steady-state responses to oxygen concentration.
  • Panels C and D: time-resolved reoxygenation responses.

# Title & Axes :
  • Panel A: "Steady state response, varying κ at β = 8"
    – X-axis: "O₂" (oxygen concentration, relative to Kₘ), log scale, range 0.001 to 1.
    – Y-axis: "relative amounts", range 0 to 1.
  • Panel B: "Steady state response, varying β at κ = 20"

    – Y-axis: "relative amounts", range 0 to 1.
  • Panel D: "Reoxygenation, varying β at κ = 20"
    – X-axis: "Time [τ_A]", range 0 to 2.
    – Y-axis: "relative amounts", range 0 to 1.

# Data Points :
  • Series: "unhydrox. ARs" (grey), "free FIH" (blue).
  • Panel A: κ values (2, 4, 20) shown as different line styles (dotted, dashed, solid).
  • Panel B: β values (2, 4, 8, 16) shown as different line styles (dotted, dashed, solid, dash-dot).
  • Panel C: κ values (2, 4, 20) as in A, time course from t = 0 to t = 2.
  • Panel D: β values (2, 4, 8, 16) as in B, time course from t = 0 to t = 2.
  • No explicit data points; curves only.

# Design Encodings :
  • "unhydrox. ARs": grey lines, various dash styles for parameter values.
  • "free FIH": blue lines, matching dash styles.
  • Logarithmic x-axis for panels A and B.
  • Shaded region in panels C and D indicates hypoxia (O₂ = 0.01) before t = 0.
  • Legend in each panel for series identification.
  • Parameter values (κ or β) labeled on or near curves.

# Distribution & Trends :
  • In panels A and B, "unhydrox. ARs" decrease and "free FIH" increase with rising O₂.
  • Higher κ (panel A) or β (panel B) shifts the transition to higher O₂ and sharpens the response.
  • In panels C and D, reoxygenation at t = 0 causes a rapid drop in "unhydrox. ARs" and a rise in "free FIH".
  • Higher κ (panel C) or β (panel D) leads to a sharper and/or faster response.

# Analysis :
  • The dynamic range and sharpness of FIH release are strongly influenced by κ (sequestration capacity) and β (hydroxylation efficiency).
  • Increasing κ sharpens the transition in both steady-state and time-resolved responses, but does not affect the timing of FIH release.
  • Increasing β both sharpens and accelerates the FIH release, shifting the oxygen threshold for response.
  • The system shows a switch-like response to oxygen, with parameter-dependent sensitivity and timing.
  • The figure supports the conclusion that both ARD pool size/affinity and hydroxylation efficiency are key determinants of FIH-release dynamics. <!-- figure, from page 9 (l=0.091,t=0.108,r=0.911,b=0.765), with ID 2275c1c8-8664-4baa-99ad-c9c9738b8b08 -->

of ARs over FIH, can only happen if hydroxylation of
FIH-accessible ARs approaches completion. The time
required for FIH to hydroxylate ARs to a sufficient
degree to overcome sequestration explains the time
delay between reoxygenation and FIH-release. This
behaviour also allows modulation of the timing of FIH-
release as a function of the strength and duration of the
preceding hypoxic episode, a feature we explore using
the Full Model at the end of the following section. <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.089,t=0.780,r=0.494,b=0.919), with ID 8f5f34e8-b7b0-4a97-976b-144efda19743 -->

The Full Model - the effects of the FIH/ARD protein interaction on HIFα CAD-hydroxylation  
Having simulated the interdependency of HIFα CAD-hydroxylation and oxygen-dependent degradation of HIFα (SKM1), as well as the requirements for efficient, oxygen-dependent release of FIH from ARD proteins (SKM2), we next fused the skeleton models into a Full Model, which we use to investigate the effects of ARD protein hydroxylation on the steady state levels and the <!-- text, from page 9 (l=0.507,t=0.779,r=0.911,b=0.920), with ID 1d257249-dec9-4a27-aab9-6c5752d8e532 -->

temporal response of HIFα CAD-hydroxylation. If the
conditions for efficient FIH-release as previously defined
by analysis of SKM2 are met, the Full Model predicts a
similar sharp and efficient FIH-release above an oxygen
threshold, and additionally suggests that this feature is
robustly retained over a wide range of ARD protein con-
centrations. The position of the oxygen threshold for
FIH-release is predicted to be determined by the total
number of ARs that are FIH targets (Figure 5A, left
hand panel). Importantly, the oxygen-threshold for FIH-
release translates into an oxygen-threshold for HIFα
CAD-hydroxylation (Figure 5A, right hand panel). Below
the threshold, non-CAD-hydroxylated HIFα is kept at
high levels. The drop at the oxygen threshold is much
sharper than in the absence of an FIH/AR-interaction
(green solid curves, compare $A_{tot} = 0$ with e.g. $A_{tot} =
100$, see also Figure S2). Increasing the number of FIH-
accessible ARs shifts the oxygen threshold and the
decreasing peak values of CAD-hydroxylated HIFα
towards higher oxygen-tensions and narrows the oxygen
range in which CAD-hydroxylated HIFα can accumulate
(Figure 5A, right hand panel). Overall, the Full Model
predicts that competition by ARD proteins for FIH
introduces an ultrasensitive dependence of HIFα CAD-
hydroxylation on oxygen levels. The position of the oxy-
gen threshold above which HIFα CAD-hydroxylation
occurs is determined by the concentration of AR-type
hydroxylation targets, as is the range of oxygen tensions
into which HIFα CAD-hydroxylation is focused. We
conclude that the FIH/AR-interaction can cause HIFα
CAD-hydroxylation to respond ultrasensitively to chang-
ing oxygen levels, and that it can contribute to deter-
mining the oxygen-range over the degree of hypoxia at
which CAD-hydroxylated HIFα will accumulate. <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.090,t=0.109,r=0.494,b=0.621), with ID c3a44883-2bdd-466b-9c44-566ca3ec7dec -->

Up to now we have assumed that FIH does not bind
at all to hydroxylated ARs. To make the Full Model
more realistic, we now allow such product binding to
happen and introduce a parameter 0 <γ < 1, which is
the binding affinity of FIH for hydroxylated ARs relative
to its affinity for unhydroxylated ARs. It becomes clear
that even weak binding of FIH to hydroxylated ARs (γ <
1) can strongly attenuate the levels of free FIH at high
oxygen tensions (Figure 5B, left hand panel). The peak
values of CAD-hydroxylated HIFα (Figure 5B, right
hand panel) are also decreased. Importantly however,
while binding of FIH to hydroxylated ARs attenuates the
steepness of the response curve, the existence of an oxy-
gen threshold is entirely independent of such binding.
Experiments suggest that there is indeed a substantial
differential between the FIH binding affinity for non-
CAD-hydroxylated versus CAD-hydroxylated ARs [13],
and we predict that this difference is essential for
achieving significant HIFα CAD-hydroxylation and the
sharpest possible response curves. <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.089,t=0.622,r=0.494,b=0.926), with ID 630af5c4-6985-4466-9548-52b5a290d1d2 -->

FIH-dependent Asn-hydroxylation is, to the best of our knowledge, irreversible and can only be reversed indirectly by degradation of the Asn-hydroxylated proteins and de novo synthesis of unhydroxylated proteins. Thus, the mean life times of the competing substrates, ARD-proteins and HIFα, are expected to be important parameters. To test this, we varied the parameter ε, which is the ratio of the mean life time of ARD-proteins relative to the mean life time of HIFα under basal turn-over conditions, i.e. in the absence of oxygen. The Full Model predicts that long-lived ARD proteins (large ε) decrease the oxygen-tension at which FIH-release occurs (Figure 5C, left hand panel). Consequently, if ε is large, FIH is already released at oxygen-tensions at which PHD-activity is still only moderate, and a substantial amount of HIFα is available for CAD-hydroxylation, leading to increased peak values of CAD-hydroxylated HIFα and a sharper response (Figure 5C, right hand panel). The exact value of ε then determines both the degree of hypoxia at which HIFα CAD-hydroxylation can occur, and the extent to which CAD-hydroxylation HIFα can accumulate. <!-- text, from page 10 (l=0.507,t=0.108,r=0.911,b=0.442), with ID 39ca55bf-8c11-4e99-ac84-d8f44e8a68d4 -->

In addition to these steady state calculations, we also
used the Full Model to simulate the effect of the FIH/
AR-interaction on the temporal behaviour of the sys-
tem in response to both hypoxia and to reoxygenation
after hypoxia. We compared the hypothetical case of
constitutive FIH activity (no FIH/AR-interaction) with
the situation where FIH activity is regulated by ARs
through sequestration and oxygen-dependent release.
The simulations were performed for two different
degrees of hypoxia, severe and moderate. In the case
of constitutively active FIH, reoxygenation from severe
hypoxia is predicted to cause a strong and transient
burst in HIFα CAD-hydroxylation at early time points
after reoxygenation (Figure 6A, red curve), which is
attenuated if the preceding hypoxia was moderate (Fig-
ure 6B, red curve). Irrespective of the strength of the
preceding hypoxic episode, in the absence of an FIH/
AR-interaction nearly all HIFα is predicted to become
CAD-hydroxylated prior to its oxygen-dependent
degradation (Figures 6A, B). In the presence of an
FIH/AR-interaction by contrast, the Full Model pre-
dicts the existence of a temporal threshold for FIH-
release, which now occurs with a time delay in a
switch-like fashion (Figures 6C and 6D, blue curves).
These results are consistent with the predictions by
SKM2 (Figure 4E, F). As a consequence of the delayed
FIH-release, and in stark contrast to the case of constitu-
tive FIH activity, the Full Model predicts that nearly
all HIFα is degraded before its CAD can be hydroxyl-
ated (Figure 6C and 6D), which precludes the burst of
HIFα CAD-hydroxylation upon reoxygenation seen in

Summary : This figure presents a series of signal/response curves from a mathematical model, showing how varying key parameters (amounts of ARD proteins, FIH binding affinities, and timescales) affect the steady-state concentrations of free FIH, unhydroxylated ARD-sequestering ARs, total HIFα, non-CAD-hydroxylated HIFα, and CAD-hydroxylated HIFα as functions of oxygen concentration (O₂). The figure is divided into three main panels (A, B, C), each with two subpanels, and includes detailed legends and parameter annotations.

# Figure Legend :
  • Figure 5 Full Model, signal/response curves for varying parameter values.
  • Describes the meaning of each parameter (A_tot, γ, ε) and the biological interpretation of the curves.
  • Explains how each parameter affects the oxygen threshold for FIH release and HIFα CAD-hydroxylation.

# Analysis :
  • The model predicts that increasing ARD protein amount (A_tot) shifts the oxygen threshold for FIH release and HIFα CAD-hydroxylation to higher O₂ concentrations, with sharper transitions.
  • Higher FIH binding affinity for hydroxylated ARDs (γ) reduces the efficiency of FIH release and HIFα CAD-hydroxylation, flattening and shifting the response curves.
  • Increasing the timescale ratio ε (faster HIFα turnover relative to ARD turnover) sharpens and shifts the response to higher O₂, making the system more sensitive to hypoxia.
  • The presence and stability of ARD proteins, FIH binding affinities, and turnover rates all critically modulate the hypoxic response as modeled by these signal/response curves. <!-- figure, from page 11 (l=0.091,t=0.110,r=0.909,b=0.921), with ID eec08649-faf0-44f7-b754-61302e825c81 -->

  • In regulated FIH models (C, D), "any form of HIFα" and subtypes also drop after reoxygenation, but "free FIH" increases, and "unhydrox. ARs" decrease.
  • In hypoxia onset scenarios (E, F), "any form of HIFα" and subtypes increase after hypoxia, "free FIH" decreases, and "unhydrox. ARs" increase.
  • The magnitude and speed of changes differ between severe and moderate hypoxia.

# Analysis :
  • Constitutive FIH models show rapid loss of HIFα forms after reoxygenation, with free FIH unaffected by oxygen changes.
  • Regulated FIH models display dynamic changes in free FIH and unhydrox. ARs, indicating feedback or competition effects.
  • The presence of FIH/AR-interaction (regulated FIH) leads to more complex, time-dependent responses, especially in free FIH and unhydrox. ARs.
  • The severity of hypoxia (severe vs. moderate) affects the amplitude and timing of the responses.
  • Overall, regulated FIH models capture additional regulatory dynamics not present in constitutive models, particularly in response to oxygen transitions. <!-- figure, from page 12 (l=0.092,t=0.110,r=0.910,b=0.924), with ID 1f14fdcf-bbda-44a8-8511-cb70bf548338 -->

6A and 6C, red curves). The length of the delay in
FIH-release depends on the hydroxylation status of the
ARD protein pool. Because more severe, or longer,
hypoxia leads to a higher fraction of FIH-binding ARs
to be unhydroxylated, more time is required for FIH to
hydroxylate these substrates and to trigger its own
release (compare Figures 6C and 6D, blue curves and
black dotted curves). The delay in FIH-release thus is a
direct readout of the hydroxylation status of the ARD
protein pool, which in turn reflects both the strength
and the duration of the preceding hypoxic episode.
This idea relies on the following model predictions:
Firstly, the rate of accumulation of unhydroxylated
ARs during hypoxia is counteracted by residual FIH
activity and is thus dependent on the hypoxic oxygen
tension (compare Figures 6E and 6F, slope of the
dotted curves). Secondly, because Asn-hydroxylation is
irreversible, the replacement of hydroxylated ARD pro-
teins with their unhydroxylated counterparts during
hypoxia is a slow process limited by de novo protein
synthesis (compare the reoxygenation time scale in
Figures 6A-D with the hypoxia timescale in Figures 6E,
F). Due to the slow accumulation of unhydroxylated
ARD proteins in hypoxia, which additionally depends
on the residual FIH-hydroxylation activity and thus the
degree of hypoxia, the hydroxylation status of the ARD
protein pool can measure and integrate a wide range
of hypoxic strengths and durations. At the time of
reoxygenation, the hydroxylation status of the ARD
protein pool will reflect these characteristics of the
hypoxic episode, which then translate into a delay for
FIH-release. For completion, the temporal behaviour in
response to hypoxia in the absence of an FIH/AR-
reoxygenation is shown in the Additional File 3,
Figure S3. <!-- text, from page 13 (l=0.090,t=0.109,r=0.494,b=0.637), with ID da642b8f-3451-4331-8d96-6ebda17e8414 -->

In summary, steady-state simulations with the Full
Model suggest that, in the absence of other variables, a
low binding affinity of FIH for already hydroxylated
ARs, as well as a fast basal turnover of HIFα compared
to the average turnover of ARD proteins are essential
requirements for efficient HIFα CAD-hydroxylation.
The model predicts two functionally significant effects
of oxygen-dependent FIH-release from ARD proteins,
which are emergent system properties that shape the
hypoxic response: The process of HIFα CAD-hydroxyl-
ation is focused into a defined range of oxygen-tensions
(range-finding mechanism), and the signal/response
curves are significantly sharpened (ultrasensitivity). Time
course simulations further suggest that a delay in FIH-
release in response to reoxygenation provides a readout
of the hydroxylation status of the ankyrin-pool, which in
turn encodes or “memorises” duration and strength of
the preceding hypoxic episode. <!-- text, from page 13 (l=0.089,t=0.638,r=0.494,b=0.910), with ID 6d27e828-11da-4d47-84af-c17abef099ba -->

Discussion  
Several kinetic models of the HIF-pathway have been reported, each focusing on different aspects of this signalling system [35-38]. Only one of these models considers FIH and HIFα CAD-hydroxylation, but this does not include ARD proteins as competing FIH substrates [35]. Predictions derived from SKM1, which ignores the FIH/AR-interaction, support previous experimental [7] and theoretical work [35]. Despite its simplicity, SKM1 successfully reproduces the findings that, first, expression of CAD-dependent genes requires more severe hypoxia when compared to NAD-dependent genes, and second, that higher FIH activity increases the magnitude of this shift towards severe hypoxia (Figure 3). These features are generic properties that are valid whether or not the FIH/AR interaction is taken into account. Our proposal that there is an additional group of target genes that relies on the hydroxylated CAD for transcriptional activation in a CBP/P300-independent manner provides a possible explanation for the unusual activation profile of HIF target genes such as BNIP3 [7]. The existence of such a target gene group however requires experimental verification. Because FIH needs to compete with PHD-induced degradation of HIFα, SKM1 predicts that HIFα CAD-hydroxylation can only occur to a significant extent if FIH-dependent hydroxylation is at least as effective as PHD-dependent hydroxylation (see α = 1 in Figure 3A for identical activities of FIH and PHDs). This is true even in the hypothetical absence of an inhibitory FIH/AR-interaction, i.e. if FIH-activity towards HIFα is constitutive and maximal. Indeed, FIH has been suggested to be a more efficient enzyme than the PHDs because of its lower K_M for oxygen, for which there is in vitro evidence [30]. Our SKM1 predictions modify this notion, indicating that efficient HIFα CAD-hydroxylation does not specifically depend on the K_M of FIH for oxygen, but more generally on intracellular FIH activity. Expression levels of FIH relative to PHDs thus are predicted to play a major role in vivo in determining the extent of HIFα CAD-hydroxylation at a given oxygen tension, and accurate measurements of relative expression levels of FIH and PHDs are desirable. <!-- text, from page 13 (l=0.507,t=0.109,r=0.912,b=0.744), with ID 99e3e5f6-2cd9-4420-b55b-fced587018da -->

The focus of our work was on the regulation of FIH
activity towards HIFα through competitive inhibition by
ARD proteins. The large number of ARD proteins, a
substantial fraction of which we predict to be FIH tar-
gets, and the fact that at least some isolated ankyrin-
domains bind more tightly to FIH than to HIFα [13,39]
make it seem possible that ARs will out-compete HIFα
and prevent significant HIFα CAD-hydroxylation irre-
spective of the oxygen concentration. However, HIFα
clearly is CAD-hydroxylated by FIH in vivo, and a con-
clusive theory needs to consolidate this fact with the <!-- text, from page 13 (l=0.508,t=0.744,r=0.911,b=0.912), with ID 070bef0e-a0b0-4e69-86dd-f11acfdf80f5 -->

presence and the action of FIH-binding ARD proteins.
Several factors can potentially contribute to weakening
the competition by ARD proteins for FIH. First, not all
ARD proteins are expected to be expressed in a particu-
lar cell type. Second, the ARD is a protein-protein inter-
action motif, and only a fraction of a given ARD protein
is expected to be accessible to FIH in vivo. Third, affi-
nity constants measured in vitro with isolated protein
domains might be misleading. These considerations
make it difficult to give an estimate of a realistic con-
centration of FIH binding target repeats, and FIH
sequestration could be much less pronounced than
expected from idealised theoretical considerations. Irre-
spective of its actual extent however, FIH sequestration
by ARD proteins must be oxygen-regulated in order to
tune HIFα CAD-hydroxylation, other than just repres-
sing it at all oxygen tensions, and experimental evidence
points to hydroxylation-dependent release of FIH from
ARD-proteins as the responsible mechanism. SKM2 pre-
dicts that such FIH-release only occurs if hydroxylation
of FIH-accessible ARs approaches completion. Impor-
tantly, this prediction is not in contrast with experimen-
tal findings indicating that the hydroxylation of an
individual AR is often far from complete, even under
conditions of high oxygen [11,13,15]. Because the ARD
is a protein-protein interaction domain, the access of
FIH to the ARDs will be restricted by the presence of
ARD-interactors other than FIH, which will partly pro-
tect ankyrin repeats from FIH-dependent hydroxylation.
Thus, it is possible that near-complete hydroxylation of
a specific AR may not be observed experimentally, but
the hydroxylation of its FIH-accessible fraction might
actually approach completion. <!-- text, from page 14 (l=0.090,t=0.109,r=0.494,b=0.606), with ID 048afaa7-2fc2-4621-9aeb-fcb531890b42 -->

We identify several potential functional effects of the
FIH/AR-interaction on HIFα CAD-hydroxylation. The
Full Model predicts that the FIH/AR-interaction intro-
duces an oxygen-threshold, below which HIFα CAD-
hydroxylation is marginal and CAD-dependent genes
are fully active. The exact threshold concentration of
oxygen, above which HIFα CAD-hydroxylation can
occur and CAD-dependent genes are turned off, is pre-
dicted to be determined by the total amount of FIH-
accessible, hydroxylatable ARs, their binding affinity for
FIH, as well as by the relative turnover rates of HIFα
and ARD proteins and should thus be tunable by modu-
lating these system features. A range finding property is
essential for the HIF hydroxylases to act as oxygen sen-
sors in environments with different physiologically rele-
vant ranges of oxygen concentrations [1]. Although it is
unlikely that the FIH/AR-interaction is the only range-
finding mechanism in the HIF system, our results
demonstrate that it is one possible such mechanism.
The change in CAD-hydroxylation at the oxygen <!-- text, from page 14 (l=0.090,t=0.608,r=0.493,b=0.910), with ID cfdcbedd-e823-4fa9-aa68-03625dc4cecb -->

threshold is significantly sharpened compared to the
absence of an FIH/AR-interaction. Such ultrasensitivity,
as characterised by a sigmoid signal/response curve, is
an important feature of many signalling pathways and
cellular decision making processes. Mechanisms giving
rise to ultrasensitive behaviour include cooperativity,
multi-site modification, zero-order ultrasensitivity, and
positive feedback. In our case, the mechanism causing
ultrasensitivity is similar to a proposed “ultrasensitivity
by substrate competition”, where stoichiometric inhibi-
tion of an enzyme by a competing substrate can make
enzyme activity for other substrates nonlinearly depen-
dent on the enzyme level [40]. Finally, time course
simulations using SKM2 (Figure 4) and the Full Model
(Figure 6) predict that FIH-release can occur in a
switch-like fashion with a time delay after reoxygenation
of hypoxic cells. The length of this delay depends on the
intensity and the duration of the preceding hypoxic per-
iod. Functionally, this time delay in FIH-release can pre-
vent a premature FIH-release during a brief and perhaps
only transient reoxygenation event, and only sustained
reoxygenation will trigger bulk FIH-release. <!-- text, from page 14 (l=0.507,t=0.108,r=0.910,b=0.444), with ID ce78a01c-6d76-4c94-ad65-92fffe888cdd -->

Conclusions
Overall, the combined modelling results reveal that the interaction of multiple ARD proteins with FIH has the potential to significantly input on the dynamics of the hypoxic response in human cells. The FIH/AR-interaction can provide a mechanism by which the oxygen-threshold for the hypoxic response can be varied (range finding mechanism), it can confer substantial sharpening of the signal/response curves (ultrasensitivity), and it can create a time-delay for CAD-hydroxylation after reoxygenation, the length of which can encode the strength and duration of the preceding hypoxic episode (a memory effect). The modulation of HIF hydroxylase activity is of considerable interest with respect to therapeutic intervention. Inhibition of the HIF hydroxylases may be useful for treatment of anaemia and ischemic disease, via the upregulation of erythropoiesis and angiogenesis, respectively. Presently, it is unclear whether HIF hydroxylase inhibitors should target individual HIF hydroxylases or combinations of enzymes. Our results reveal that the FIH/AR-interactions should be taken into account in analyses of the cellular and physiological effects of HIF hydroxylase inhibitors, whether or not these inhibitors are selective for PHDs and/or FIH. Interfering with the binding of FIH to ARD-proteins is predicted to increase HIFα CAD-hydroxylation, whereas interfering with AR-hydroxylation by FIH is predicted to decrease HIFα CAD-hydroxylation. Thus, the FIH/AR-interaction itself is a possible prominent target for pharmacological modulation of the HIF pathway.
