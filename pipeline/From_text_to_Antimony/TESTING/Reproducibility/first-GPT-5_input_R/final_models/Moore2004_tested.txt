/* Notes and mappings from the source text:
- Domain: physiological/clinical immuno-oncology (blood-borne cell populations).
- Parameter name mappings used:
  theta := Michaelis?Menten half-saturation constant (denoted ??? in text), value 100 cells/?l.
  alpha_n := ?_n (effector yield from activated naive T cells), value 0.41.
  alpha_e := ?_e (recruitment/proliferation of effector T cells), value 0.2.
  gamma_e := ?_e (loss rate of T_e due to contact with C), value 0.005 (day^-1 per (cells/?l)).
  gamma_c := ?_c (killing rate of C by T_e), value 0.005 (day^-1 per (cells/?l)).
  C_max := maximum CML level; set to 3e5 cells/?l per text.
  r_c := Gompertz growth rate of C, value 0.03 day^-1.
- Gompertz growth implemented with natural logarithm ln(C_max/C), as described.
- Units: populations are concentrations (cells per ?l); time is in days; the compartment volume is set to 1 to preserve units of the original ODEs. */
