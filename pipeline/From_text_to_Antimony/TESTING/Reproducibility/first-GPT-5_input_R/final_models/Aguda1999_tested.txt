/* Notes and unmapped/assumed data:
- Scientific domain: molecular/cellular checkpoint signaling and cell-cycle regulation.
- The kinetic forms follow Table 1 and the ODE structure in Table 2 of Aguda (1999), mapping each Vi to an explicit reaction with the corresponding rate law.
- CTAK1 and Plk1 contributions are included as parameters (kctak2, kctak2p, kPlk1, kPlk1p) but initialized to 0 to reflect the statement that their effects can be ignored in the whole-system simulations.
- The effective ?DNA damage? stimulus is represented implicitly via constant-source activations of Rad3 (k4) and p53 (k10), consistent with v4 and v10 being fixed-rate activations.
- Initial conditions and many parameter values are not explicitly quantified in the provided text; placeholder dimensionless values are assigned to ensure the model loads and runs. Replace these with experimentally based values as needed.
- The nuclear transport processes (vin, vex) mentioned in the text and Fig. 8 were not included due to incomplete expressions in the provided excerpt.
