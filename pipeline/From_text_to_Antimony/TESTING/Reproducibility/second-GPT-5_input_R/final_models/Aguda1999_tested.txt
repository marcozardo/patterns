/* Unmapped or ambiguous numeric data from the source (kept as documentation, not enforced in the model):
- Table 1 provides symbolic rate laws Vi used above; symbols like k?, k?? in the paper were mapped to distinct parameters (k1, k_1, k2, k_2, etc.) here.
- The paper states [totalChk1] = 1 (used) and reports example initial conditions for some species (e.g., [prot14-3-3]=2, [iCdc25Ps216/14-3-3]=0.03) which have been set.
- Many parameter values in figures are given qualitatively (e.g., sets with many = 1.0, others 0.1, 0.01, or 0), but exact mappings were garbled in the provided text (e.g., k??, k.9, etc.). To avoid speculation, all kinetic constants are initialized to 0 by default here; set them as needed for specific scenarios (e.g., to reproduce Fig. 8/9).
- Nuclear export/import of Cdc25 forms (v_ex, v_in) are mentioned for whole-system simulations but explicit equations/values were not cleanly provided in the text extract; these transport processes are therefore omitted from the executable core to preserve correctness.
